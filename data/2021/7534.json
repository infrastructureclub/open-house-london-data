                "Despite some undoubted successes, a lack of investment and infrastructure has meant that Thamesmead is yet to fully to live up to initial potential. However, just over 50 years after its creation, with investment of over £1 billion now coming in, Thamesmead is now well set to fulfil its promise as London's new town.",

Its mission is to ensure that as many people as possible have a good home, a real sense of purpose and a strong feeling of belonging.",

The first\nfloor provides a multi-purpose\nspace which could provide\nfacilities such as toddler\ngroups, local clubs and yoga.\nThis is supported by further\ncommunity spaces on the\nmezzanine level which \ninclude a health room.\nThe library space is\npredominantly glazed to create\nviews both into and out of\nthe building and to make the\ninterior spaces feel connected\nto the surrounding landscape.\nThe flexible, multi-use space\nabove the main library space is\norientated differently from the\nbase of the building, rotated\nto face over Southmere Lake\nfor the fantastic views and to\nreflect the irregular form of a\nSwan’s nest.\nA wild flower green roof and\nsky light provides visual\namenity for the neighbouring\nresidents and helps to increase\nbiodiversity."
