A glazed entry lobby links the retained building (revitalised as a public sitting room) to two new rectilinear ‘wings’ running along Brondesbury Park and Grange Road respectively.",
                "The three storey elevations of each wing are expressed as three horizontal bands with varying proportions of glazing. The solid elements within these bands are highly patterned and respond to a range of contextual and feature colours, sampled from the Victorian buildings along the High Street.  These patterns are set into an articulated overall building form of white glazed brick.",
                "Inside are library facilities,  training, arts, exhibition and function spaces, as well as the Brent Archives and Brent Museum. Visually connecting all of the internal uses is a four-storey atrium, providing natural daylight and ventilation.",
                "The scheme is completed by generous public realm including a south facing new pedestrian space that will host a variety of outdoor events as well as enhancing routes through the site."
