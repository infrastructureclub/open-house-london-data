                "Begun in the late 1960s, towards the end of the vogue for high-rise social housing, it was conceived by its architect along principles that approached the utopian. A disciple of the Modernist architects Le Corbusier and Auguste Perret, Goldfinger (whose name Ian Fleming uncharitably stole after a dispute over the destruction of some Victorian housing) passionately believed in the Corbusian concept of “streets in the sky”, the idea that the social interactions of ground-level communities could be transferred into space-saving vertical formations. His buildings aimed to accommodate large numbers of people without loss of amenity.",
                "By the time that the Trellick was built though, public opinion was beginning to turn against the postwar towers. It became known in the media as the 'Tower of Terror'.",
                "In 1983, after years as an acknowledged trouble-spot, the council installed a concierge at the bottom of the Trellick and the slow recovery of its reputation began.",
                "Today, in a Britain where nearly 40,000 people belong to the Brutalism Appreciation Society and tours of the Trellick are avidly subscribed, the intricacies of Goldfinger's vision are once again appreciated."

                "Most famously, perhaps, it was the inspiration for High-Rise, the 1975 novel by JG Ballard whose film adaptation, directed by Ben Wheatley and starring Tom Hiddleston, came out in 2016."
