The vaulted north tower porch and broach spire were designed by John Thomas Bressey in the same style and added in 1869. The vestries of 1899 were designed by the local architect S. Liddon Waters.",

From the chancel arch looking towards the west end, the chaste dignity of the geometrical architecture is seen to the best advantage. The aisles are wide and each has its own roof of similar construction to that of the nave. The nave is divided from the aisles by low five-bay arcades of quatrefoil piers.",
                "A nave altar and platform were introduced in the late 20th century to accommodate changes in worship.",
                "The windows have a variety of shapes. All but two of the stained glass windows were blown out during the Second World War. The surviving chancel window was commissioned in 1925. The east window of the south aisle (the Lady Chapel) has symbols of the four evangelists.",
                "The Lady Chapel is used for weekday celebrations of Holy Communion and private prayer, and here the Blessed Sacrament is reserved. The figure of the Risen Christ above the altar was made in and shipped from Sweden."

Two additional bells were provided by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1972 and the wooden bell frame was replaced by one of steel. Wanstead is unusual in that the bells have to hang in two tiers. The peal is a light one, with the tenor weighing 8 cwt."
