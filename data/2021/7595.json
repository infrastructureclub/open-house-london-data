                "Gasholder Park is a tranquil public space set within a carefully restored guide frame of a large Victorian gasholder in the heart of London’s Kings Cross district. The gasholder guide frame is an iconic structure that is a symbolic and physical link between King’s Cross today and the site’s industrial heritage. It is one of the key landmarks on the North London skyline and is integral to the history and urban topography of the area.",
                "Within the imposing guide frame sits a mirror-finished canopy which like a kaleidoscope, dramatically reflects the colours of adjacent planting, buildings, people and activity. The two structures coexist, with the old reclaiming its place on the north London skyline while the new provides a peaceful, intimate public park within the ever-changing urban context of King’s Cross.",
                "The pavilion frames a central garden with a stunning mirror-polished stainless steel colonnade within the Victorian gasholder guide frame. The new structure provides a more intimate and contemporary counterpoint to the vast historic structure and seeks to balance the dramatic size, form and scale of the gasholder guide frame with a public space that is appropriately scaled to provide a sense of enclosure and seclusion."

                "Gasholder No.8 is a Grade II Listed Victorian structure that was decommissioned in 2000. In 2008 Bell Phillips Architects won a design competition to remodel the Gasholder as a new public space in the heart of King’s Cross.",
                "In conjunction with Argent, Arup, Shepley and BAM Nuttall, Bell Phillips Architects developed a detailed methodology for the dismantling, repair and re-erection of this incredible structure. The fragile industrial icon was dismantled and removed from its site in King’s Cross and transported to Yorkshire where it underwent repairs, refurbishment and repainting. On completion it was carefully re-erected in a more prominent position adjacent to the Regent’s Canal.",

                "The canopy was designed to avoid competing visually with the Gasholder No.8 guide frame. Taking a form that alludes to the gasholder bell, the canopy has been designed to appear light, minimal and delicate compared to the heavy industrial character of the guide frame; a product of the 21st Century just as the gasholder guide frame is a product of the Victorian age. At the same time the canopy has a sense of permanence, solidity, refinement and precision at close quarters.",
                "The canopy is a fully welded structure fabricated from mirror polished 12mm stainless steel supported by approximately 150 25mm thick polished stainless steel columns sitting radially around the perimeter of the canopy. The mirror finish to the canopy is highly reflective giving it a mirage-like quality when viewed from a distance, minimising the visual impact on the gasholder guide frame and reflecting the colours of adjacent planting, buildings, people and activity from close up. As one moves through and around the canopy the reflections constantly change, picking up different colours and textures from its surroundings and perpetually transforming itself in relation to one’s viewpoint. This gives the canopy a fascinating, kaleidoscopic and playful quality.",
                "The new canopy was designed in close collaboration with the structural engineer and fabricator to achieve a structure that is incredibly delicate and refined. The design draws great visual and structural strength from its articulation as a single monolithic piece. To achieve this appearance the canopy was fully welded to produce a single seamless, contiguous structure. Waterjet-cut perforations in the canopy roof, designed in response to the stress patterns in the steel, produce a dappled quality of light beneath the canopy and a starry quality when viewed from above at night.",
                "By night, the underside of the canopy is illuminated. Inspired by the corona generated by a solar eclipse the canopy appears as a halo of brilliant white light floating within the silhouette of the gasholder frame."
