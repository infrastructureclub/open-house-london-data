The site was owned by the Bishops of Rochester from before the Norman Conquests up until 1842 when the Palace and its extensive lands were sold to a private business man Coles Child who effectively became Lord of the Manor. In the early 1930s the surrounding farmland was sold for housing development and the Palace became home to the Stockwell College of Education.  In the 1960s and 70s extensive new building took place enclosing the Old Palace and in 1982 the site was taken over by Bromley Council"

Added a stone porch at the front with a scallop shell in its centre (coat of arms of the Bishops of Rochester) \n6.

It was a Chalybeate spring of the same type as at Tunbridge Wells. The site was lost and then rediscovered in the 18th c and marked with a small roofed structure (See adjacent explanatory plaque). The site was covered over with the present fountain basin after the Palace and grounds were acquired by Bromley Council. The Armenian St Blaise was the patron saint of wool combers which is appropriate to Bromley being, for centuries, a prominent wool producing area. Sheep were grazed on Martins Hill up unit the mid to late 19th century.",

Together with its companion structure, the Cascade beside the Ice House they are remarkable as in effect stage scenery constructed in situ from brick covered in an outer layer of render known as Pulhamite and intended to look like rocky outcrops as one might see in the Derbyshire Hills. A thin layer of natural stone cuts across as if a strata and provides extra authenticity as well as stability.  The pool is fed by a small stream rising from a spring in the back garden of a house in adjacent Rochester Avenue.",
