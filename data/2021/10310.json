Ashraya is a contemporary rural house in the Chilterns in Hertfordshire, designed by British\narchitects Kirkland Fraser Moor (KFM) and completed in 2021. The three-level building is sheltered beneath an arch covered with grassy meadow and opens onto new courtyards both sides.\nThe design of Ashraya satisfies Paragraph 80 (previously Paragraph 55 and subsequently Paragraph 79) of the National Planning Policy Framework, permitting construction of standalone rural houses if the design ‘is of exceptional quality’ and whose effect is to ‘significantly enhance its immediate setting and be sensitive to the defining characteristics of the local area.’"

                "The full profile of the house can be enjoyed from Stocks Road, which forms the site’s western boundary. It forms a glazed circle segment framed by the structure of the roof, clad in reconstituted stone. Framework of the house is precast concrete basement, which supports the cross laminated timber (CLT) structure above. \nThe house plan is a rectangle, orientated roughly along a north-south axis. The building rises between hard-surfaced semi-circular courtyards on either side, bound by new flint perimeter wall that flows seamlessly in line over the curved roof structure. The roof vegetation creates a bridge between the house and the surrounding nature.\nThe long straight historic flint wall of the adjacent walled garden on the estate is extended to swirl around the new courtyards, as well as over and above the arch, expressing a joyous and calligraphic form of engagement with the environment, reminiscent of 1960s land art."

                "Ashraya is cooled by a ground source heat pump system. The cooling system is an innovative low carbon solution that makes use of the cold ground 90m deep boreholes. This system bypasses the need for using the heat exchanger and as such requires only a fraction of the energy normally needed for mechanical air conditioning. The chimney height helps ensure that there would be a very strong draw on extracting the smoke inside a well insulated building.\nThe interiors are contemporary, robust and use materials chosen both for a healthy environment and sustainability. Some materials were perfected and applied by local craftspeople. Bedroom walls are formed of various blocks made from straw, clay, chalk, with a little natural lime. Clay blocks are particularly low in embedded carbon, at typically a tenth of aerated concrete blocks. Local clay plaster has been hand-finished in living areas to have a stone-like appearance."

Its organic form and the privacy it offers express the idea of shelter, embedded in its name, in a unique and contemporary way.\nIt is an exemplary example of a dwelling that captures the full ambition of paragraph 80 and the client hopes that in future years it will be recognised as a valuable contribution to the local architectural heritage."
