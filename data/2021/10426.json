With its unique make up, The Howard de Walden Estate retains the beauty of its period buildings, whilst repurposing and reinventing them for the requirements of the 21st century. From modern residential and office buildings, independent retailers, to cutting edge medical technology, The Estate preserves the history and celebrates the beauty of this community, ensuring it remains an attractive place for generations to come.",
