This new form of watercolour paint brought fortune to the Reeves family, allowing them to build the Dalston Colour Works, which specialized in high quality watercolour sets for schools, both private, and the new government run elementary schools. Traditionally, the elementary stages in art were taught through the copying of an example of the work of a master such as J.M.W Turner, who also used Reeves’ watercolour paint.",

                "Half of the Dalston Colour Works was demolished by bombs dropped on London during World War 2 causing the death of many members of staff. This forced Reeves & Sons to move out of their Dalston building in 1948 and into the new ‘Greyhound Colour Works’ at Enfield.",

We replaced and double-glazed all the windows, restructured the layout of public areas and installed a wheelchair accessible lift. We worked with Oxford Renewables to install biomass energy as a way to heat the building during the winter. Sustainability was at the heart of our refurbishment programme.",
