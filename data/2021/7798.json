                "On 8 December 2009, we served a S34A Notice, proposing the estates be transferred to a resident-controlled community housing association. We have stood tall for ten years, taking our destiny into our own hands.",

                "In 2016, we published the People's Plan, which proposed additional homes and improvements, and in 2018 we were designated a Neighbourhood Forum which gives us the opportunity to translate parts of the People's Plan into a Neighbourhood Plan, with legal planning status.",
                "In December 2019 the sale of the Earl's Court site to Delancey meant the 'return' of the estates to the Council and the tearing up of the demolition.",

                "Most of the new homes for social rent would be family size houses, but some would be bungalows for elderly and disabled residents. These new homes would help address overcrowding on the estates and suit tenants looking to down-size. Most of the homes for sale would be built in new storeys above, and extensions to, existing blocks of housing.",
                "Proposed improvements include: better insulation and ventilation; upgraded bins and refuse systems; glazed balconies to add space to the one bedroom flats in the tower blocks; upgraded communal areas; better control of green space; better security; enhanced landscaping with a new community garden and allotments.",
