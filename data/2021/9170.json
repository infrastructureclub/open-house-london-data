The single-tier south stand (capacity 17,500) is the UK’s largest. Street level precast concrete panels provide a robust base adding a sense of weight to the elevations. Above, 4,801 steel panels, mounted at angles and perforated, form a unifying visual element that wraps around the stadium like a veil rising and falling to complement the varying levels and lines of neighbouring buildings. A catalyst for local regeneration, supporting 3,500 new jobs and adding an estimated £293millon to the local economy annually. Inside a fully retractable pitch, makes it the first purpose-built European home of American football (NFL).",

                "Design: Adjaye Associates, opened September 2007.  A flagship venue to promote BAME arts, inspired by the late Bernie Grant, one of the UK’s first black MPs. Its location presented a challenge to create a wider presence.  There are three separate buildings. The Performance Centre, houses a 279-seat theatre, café-bar and rehearsal studios, separated from the existing buildings by an open plaza. Its façade of glass panels has a large canopy extending forward clad with horizontal battens of purple-heart timber. Sited off-centre to be more visible through gaps in the frontage buildings. Beyond, are a series of low-rise units for creative businesses. Ancillary activities are housed behind the old public baths façade in a black clad extension. The buildings are linked by a linear open space with the chimney of the old baths retained as a landmark.",

Further developed in 1938 and 1964, by 1972 the hospital had 114 patients. Closed in 1995 as Tottenham's Jewish population had reduced. Now called Sycamore Gardens, and locally listed, it was redeveloped for 79 housing units by Circle 33 (now Circle Anglia) to a design by JCMT architects.  The original spearhead railings remain."
