                "Bromley Little Theatre (BLT) has been an integral part of Bromley’s cultural life for over 80 years. Run entirely by volunteers and receiving no public subsidy, it attracts audiences of circa 12,000 people per year to its 113-seat main auditorium.",
                "BLT is housed in two linked buildings which were originally a Victorian bakery and stables built in 1888. Harold Wilson Pook started the Bromley Little Theatre Movement in 1934 and took a lease on the vacant bakery the following year. The raked auditorium was built and seating was installed having been obtained from the Alhambra Theatre in London. The theatre opened with its first production in December 1937 and, apart from a break during WW2, has been showing performances ever since.",
                "A bridge between the two buildings was installed later so that a bar and storage for props and costumes could be created. This layout of the theatre has remained intact with the original truss beams in the bar still retained.",
                "Several well-known actors began their careers here, including Michael York OBE who is the Theatre’s President.",
                "The building lies within the Bromley Town Centre Conservation Area and makes a positive contribution to the heritage interest of the area. It was part of the working side of the new shops and houses built during the rapid growth of Bromley in the late 19thC as a result of railway connectivity. The area has retained its Victorian industrial appearance with gable ends and original hoists."
