One night in the Blitz the terraced housing of Luxmore Street took a direct hit and all 12 houses were destroyed.",
                "After the war ended there was recognition that the local area lacked open space and in 1949 the local council worked to create a park that would 'provide recreational facilities for both young and elderly, in addition to which it will greatly enhance the appearance of the area' (Metropolitan Borough of Deptford Minutes of Procedings) and Luxmore Gardens formally opened to the public on 18th August 1958.",
                "Over the years it had a children's playground, toilets, a park keeper's hut and a very popular park keeper.",
                "Friends of Luxmore Gardens was formed by local residents in January 2017 after the park had become run-down and subject to anti-social behaviour. They have worked with Lewisham Council to bring improvements for people and wildlife in the park re-establishing flowerbeds, extending the playground, improving seating and establishing community events."

Luxmore Gardens was gifted three young Cherry trees by the Japanese government in 2020 as part of the Sakura Project.\n \nLuxmore Gardens is home to many birds including Wrens, Great and Blue Tits, Goldfinches and Woodpecker and the Swifts who return each Summer. There are also bats which can be seen at dusk.",
                "The planting of new beds in 2018 with indigenous shade-loving plants has seen the return of bees and butterflies and there have been sitings of stag beetles in the park for the last three years. FoLG recently planted a mini wildflower meadow to add even more interest for wildlife."

They have raised money through fundraising and grants for improvements such as planting, seating, a water fountain, extending the playground with a bespoke design from MOH design/Adventure Playground Engineers, installing a table tennis table and commissioning wildlife murals by the artist Aspire. They also run community events including the very popular yearly Love Luxmore Garden Party.",
                "Covid restrictions have meant that 2020-21 hasn't seen the organised social events return, but FoLG volunteers have continued to plant, weed and water to maintain the beauty of the park. Luxmore Gardens was an essential and incredibly well used outdoor space during the lockdown - a real lifeline to any who did not have their own outdoor space."
