He started with his own private collection of some half-dozen reproducing pianos, and in 1963 he was given use of the former St George’s Church, Brentford to get the collection under one roof. He was initially allowed use of the premises for only two years, but the museum was still there 40 years later!",
                "In 1966, the collection was formed into a Charitable Trust as The British Piano Museum, and in the early years, a number of famous pianists who had recorded rolls earlier in the century, came along to the Museum to hear themselves play.",
                "During its existence, the Museum’s collection has grown steadily and it now encompasses a wide range of musical instruments and unique inventions which tell the story of how music was recorded and captured through the ages. The Museum has also built up a nationally significant collection of over 20,000 music rolls, which are stored in a purpose-built library."

It complements the Musical Museum’s existing extensive mechanical, electric and electronic music displays from either side of these dates and all exhibits have been lent from private collections so that many of the rarest items will never have been seen in public before.",
