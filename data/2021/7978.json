                "Elephant Springs is a spectacular new natural stone and water landscape set within Elephant Park.",
                "Renowned landscape architects, Gillespies, spearheaded the design of Elephant Springs, in collaboration with artist Mel Chantrey of The Fountain Workshop, who previously designed the waterscape for the Diana, Princess of Wales, memorial playground. Inspired by the mental and physical health benefits of spending time outdoors with nature, Elephant Springs brings a natural play experience for both children and adults within the heart of Elephant & Castle.",
                "A sculptural work of art in itself, Elephant Springs features rocky mounds over two metres high, covering an area of 420sq metres and is constructed entirely from 600 colourful porphyry stone slabs, sourced from a quarry in the Albiano region of Italy. Water naturally bubbles up from Elephant Springs’ rock formations and the stones blend seamlessly into the surrounding landscape.",
                "‘Village’ pumps, cascading water channels and motion activated water jets, provide active, fun and educational experiences. With carefully arranged stone formations, hand laid by a family of stonemasons, the space has been purposefully designed to provide a multifunctional and accessible experience for every visitor, and has been fitted with seating perches and wheelchair ramps. As a day to night destination, Elephant Springs is lit by dappled lighting as the sun sets, enhancing reflections of the waterfalls and sculptural effects of the space well into the evening.",
                "As London welcomes visitors back, Elephant Springs provides a new meeting point for families and friends to be together and reconnect once again. Nestled amongst the mature trees that are integral to the brand new two-acre park, this special spot in the heart of London offers a place of rest, relaxation, play and delight for all."
