This district-wide energy system is one of the largest of its kind in the UK and is also the first site in Great Britain to be run on green gas reducing its carbon footprint by over 50% per annum.",

The tour will explore the impact of the aerial bombardment of the Second World War and the area’s decline in the second half of the 20th Century.
