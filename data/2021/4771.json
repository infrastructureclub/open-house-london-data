                "Two Temple Place was commissioned in the early 1890s by one of the richest men in the world, expatriate New Yorker William Waldorf Astor, to be his private estate office.  Designed by the famous architect John Loughborough Pearson, it is an extraordinary celebration of late-Victorian design and craftsmanship.",
                "William was born in America in 1848, the only child of John Jacob Astor III and Charlotte Augusta Gibbes. When his father died in 1890, William inherited a personal fortune worth $100 million. He emigrated to Britain after repeated threats of kidnap, squabbles with his family and because he regarded America as ‘no fit place for a gentleman’.",
                "In 1893 William acquired the Cliveden Estate from the Duke of Westminster and blocked off the grounds from public access prompting the sobriquet, “Waldorf by name, walled-off by nature”. In 1903 he purchased Hever Castle, once the childhood home of Anne Boleyn."

Each is crowned by a miniature ship and decorated with androgynous putti who represented the marvels of electrical illumination and the latest technology - the telephone."

The carved figures represent the chief characters from William Waldorf Astor’s favourite book – Alexandre Dumas’ The Three Musketeers: D’Artagnan, Madame Bonacieux, Aramis, Milady de Winter, Bazin, Athos and Porthos.",
                "The arcade surrounding the Gallery on the first floor has ten columns of irreplaceable solid ebony. On six of these stand  carved characters from three American novels:  Uncas, the last Mohican and The Pathfinder from James Fenimore Cooper’s Leatherstocking Tales; Hester Prynne and Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale from Nathaniel Hawthorne’s Scarlet Letter; Rip van Winkle and his daughter, Judith Gardenier, from Washington Irving’s Knickerbocker Tales.",

                "The mahogany door is elegantly adorned with cupid figures imitating Renaissance grotesques. Above door and bookcases are a number of panels modeled in delicate low relief by William S Frith. Between them are finely carved putto figures representing the Arts and Sciences - each carrying scientific and musical instruments."

                "Above this are twelve carved figures which represent characters from Sir Walter Scott’s Ivanhoe, including Robin Hood, Maid Marian, Gurth, Wamba and Friar Tuck. All carved by Nathaniel Hitch, as most of the room. Hitch reluctantly gilded thee figures on Astor's request, as he struggled to see them due to his short-sightedness."
