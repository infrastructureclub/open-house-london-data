                "Two Temple Place was commissioned in the early 1890s by one of the richest men in the world, expatriate New Yorker William Waldorf Astor, to be his London estate office.  Designed by the famous gothic revivalist architect, John Loughborough Pearson, it is an extraordinary celebration of late-Victorian design and craftsmanship.",
                "Astor was born in New York City in 1848 as the only child of John Jacob Astor III and Charlotte Augusta Gibbes. Only two generations earlier, his great grandfather, John Jacob Astor I, had left the village of Walldorf, near Heidelberg in South West Germany, to find a future for himself across the Atlantic. And what a future he found: after amassing massive profits through fur trading and a vast shipping empire, he ploughed his money into property on Manhattan Island, earning the title the ‘Landlord of New York’.",
                "Only three generations of property development later, the William Waldorf Astor of Two Temple Place was part of one of the richest ever dynasties in US history. When his father died in 1890, William inherited a personal fortune worth $100 million. Interviewing Astor at Two Temple Place for his 1906 book, The Future in America, H.G. Wells wrote:",
                "“…[William Waldorf Astor] draws gold from New York as effectually as a ferret draws blood from a rabbit.”",
                "But Astor’s relationship with America was unhappy, and one of mutual aversion to the press. In 1892, perhaps to disappear from public view, he sent a report of his own death to the US papers, and was rewarded by unkind obituaries; his time in the States was well and truly over.",
                "Emigrating to England in 1890, after repeated threats of kidnap, squabbles with his family and because he regarded America as ‘no fit place for a gentleman’, he had soon bought Cliveden, the remarkable 17th century country house in Buckinghamshire, as well as Anne Boleyn’s family home Hever Castle in Kent, a home in Brighton (where the locals referred to him as “Waldorf by name and walled-off by nature”), and an astonishing seafront villa in Sorrento. But it is in his commission for the construction of this lavish office in central London that we get an insight into Astor’s own interests and aspirations. He handed his architect, the acclaimed John Loughborough Pearson, an unlimited budget for Two Temple Place and the result reads like a short biography of Astor, created for him by some of greatest craftsmen of the time."

The carved figures represent the chief characters from William Waldorf Astor’s favourite book – Alexandre Dumas’ The Three Musketeers: D’Artagnan, Madame Bonacieux, Aramis, Milady de Winter, Bazin, Athos and Porthos.",

On six of these stand  carved characters from three American novels:  Uncas, the last Mohican and The Pathfinder from James Fenimore Cooper’s Leatherstocking Tales; Hester Prynne and Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale from Nathaniel Hawthorne’s Scarlet Letter; Rip van Winkle and his daughter, Judith Gardenier, from Washington Irving’s Knickerbocker Tales.",

Above door and bookcases are a number of panels modeled in delicate low relief by William S Frith. Between them are finely carved putto figures representing the Arts and Sciences - each carrying scientific and musical instruments."

                "Above this are twelve carved figures which represent characters from Sir Walter Scott’s Ivanhoe, including Robin Hood, Maid Marian, Gurth, Wamba and Friar Tuck. All carved by Nathaniel Hitch, as most of the room. Hitch reluctantly gilded thee figures on Astor's request, as he struggled to see them due to his short-sightedness."
