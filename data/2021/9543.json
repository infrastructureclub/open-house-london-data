                "The bold and dynamic new  1,807m2 Teaching & Learning  Centre sits within a sensitive  heritage context on Euston Road.  \nThe extension and refurbishment of 1920s  373 Euston Road will provide much  needed teaching space and will showcase  Birkbeck to a wider audience, establishing  the new Teaching & Learning Centre as  a vibrant campus destination for students  and staff for this world-class educational  institution. \nThe design will create a striking landmark  for the University, taking full advantage of  its prominent corner location to provide  Birkbeck with a keynote building. Clad in  copper standing seam, the new massing  of the extension is a sculpted geometric  design that refreshes and reinvigorates the  existing building below and alludes to its  21st century environment within. \nWhilst 373 Euston Road has not been  identified as a heritage asset, the site  is located amongst listed buildings,  conservation areas and a registered park  of historic interest. The extension aims to  create ‘a beautiful moment’ that addresses  both the character of Warren Street and  its residential neighbourhood, as well as  the dominant scale of Euston Road. \nThe 6 storey plus basement level will  accommodate a café and learning hub  for students on the ground floor and  basement. High quality teaching and  learning spaces fill the upper floors with  a large modern lecture theatre informing  the sculpted rooftop extension. Existing  refurbished floor space of the building  amounts to 1,407m2, while the new  extension will provide 400m2 of additional  space. \nCurrently pre-assessed to achieve Excellent  rating for BREEAM UK New Construction  2014, the sustainability strategy is driven  by the London Plan and based on the ‘Be  Lean, Be Clean and Be Green’ hierarchy.  Photovoltaic panels on the main roof  will provide the required 35% reduction  of CO2 emissions, and generate on-site  electricity."
