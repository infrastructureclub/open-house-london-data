The block was not rebuilt, and Block D was demolished as it had been badly damaged.  In 1995 a memorial was unveiled at the estate which lists the names of the people known to have died in the tragedy."

                "The internal layouts are arranged around the single stair and lift core that provides access to 13 homes over 5 floors. Most of their habitable rooms are oriented south or west, the building is Part M compliant and has a wheelchair accessible flat to the north of the ground-floor.",
                "The large balconies to the new flats are internal to maintain the solid and object-like character of the new building. They are open to at least two sides with nearly full width openings and a low solid balustrade to maximise daylight into the living rooms located adjacent to them.",
                "Awards and recognition: Darbishire Place was a 2015 RIBA National award winner and one of six buildings shortlisted for the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize."
