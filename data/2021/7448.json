The warehouse is now home to architects Cullinan Studio, who completed an extensive retrofit of the building into their new offices in 2012. This beautiful and efficient workplace proves that retrofit can be as inspiring as new-build. Cullinan Studio is using their first-hand experience as client, designer and end-user of the building to observe how users interact with the space after handover, and putting that knowledge to good use in future projects."

The north wall has insulation of up to 380mm thick over the existing rendered façade providing a u-value of 0.08W/sqm/K. PV panels on the south slopes of the roof generate electricity. A Building Management System (BMS) enables us to monitor energy performance and space temperatures."
