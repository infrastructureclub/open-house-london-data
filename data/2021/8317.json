Guides will be on hand to interpret the history of the house and its most famous tenant, and talk about the site's exciting residency and exhibition programme. Visitors will be able to explore the house and view artefacts uncovered during the recent conservation of the building, gaining a glimpse into the stories hidden within its walls.",
                "Visitors will also be able to see our new exhibition:  \"Life and its most trivial particulars\" by artists Brian Griffiths and Frank Kent. In the form of a photographic installation across all eight rooms of the restored 3-storey Georgian terraced house, the exhibition responds to the accumulated histories of the building, from the early 19th century to the present day. Drawing on themes from Van Gogh’s life and work, \"Life and its most trivial particulars\" builds connections that reflect Griffiths’ and Kent’s own imaginings of the artist, his myth and legacy.

                "While Van Gogh’s brief tenancy at 87 Hackford Road has left a lasting legacy at the residence that contributed to its conservation status, the house has a rich history that both pre-dates and supersedes Van Gogh’s time in London."

London’s urban footprint was rapidly expanding, and the area surrounding Hackford Road was mostly farmland and fields.",
                "Discovered under one of the floorboards in Van Gogh’s bedroom was a collection of children’s toys and scraps of handwriting, one reading “Carefully, Carefully” signed and dated by a James Wigmore in 1858, followed by the lines “Embrace every opportunity of acquiring knowledge”, dated 1861 in a smaller, more sophisticated script.",
                "Census records show that James belonged to the Wigmore Family. He was the eldest of 7 sons and was thirteen years old by 1861. Wigmore’s objects remind us that by the time Van Gogh became a lodger at the house, 87 Hackford Road had already enjoyed nearly 50 years of history."

When unfolded, Mrs Loyer’s signature was clearly visible: these were her house insurance documents, dated to the years Van Gogh lived at the residence. Slipped in with these papers was a small, well-thumbed book of prayers, published in 1867 by Frederick Warne & Co."

                "At the time, the house’s residents were Arthur and Marjorie Smith. The Smiths had moved to Hackford Road in the early 1960s and were baffled to learn that the eponymous artist had lived at the house. Suddenly, their home became an attraction for coachloads of tourists and art historians. A blue plaque was fixed to the building followed by the designation of a conservation area and subsequent Grade II listing of the property."

The exhibition is the first in a new annual commissioning programme at Van Gogh House, marking 50 years since 87 Hackford Road was found to be the London residence of the renowned Dutch artist.In the form of a photographic installation across all eight rooms of the restored 3-storey Georgian terraced house, \"Life and its most trivial particulars\" responds to the accumulated histories and\nconstructed realities of the building, from the early 19th century to the present day. Transposing still life and landscape, everyday materials and objects, sculptors Griffiths and Kent present their carefully staged and situated photographs as sideways moments of focus and narrative.",
                "Drawing on themes from Van Gogh’s life and work, Life and its most trivial particulars builds associated fictions and connections that reflect Griffiths’ and Kent’s own imaginings of the artist, his myth and legacy. The works are informed by a wide range of references from Van Gogh’s early works such as Potato Field (1883), the artist’s evolving colour palette, Bob Law’s sculpture Vincent’s Chair (1984) and the writings of Charles Dickens; to the sight of a church roof in Gainsborough, a Japanese parasol, and everyday found objects collected from car boot sales and Griffiths’ and Kent’s studios. Within the composition of each photograph is an open cube, a framing device that presses objects into action and flattens three-dimensional space. The objects are arranged with an improvised formality, the resulting images depicting spaces that appear both imagined and ordered, and often with a comedic edge.",
                "Livia Wang, Creative Director at Van Gogh House said, “The carefully considered relationships between object, stage and frame in Life and its most trivial particulars truly resonate with our approach to the house. Griffiths and Kent’s playful process of collaboration creates compositions with their own atmosphere, story and natural humour, an alternate rewriting of the infamous collaboration between Van Gogh and Gaugin.”",
                "Griffiths and Kent met at the Royal Academy Schools where Griffiths is a lecturer and Kent was a student, and soon after they began a collaborative artistic practice, culminating in AIR SIGNS, an ongoing series of photographic sculptural installations, first presented at Karsten Schubert in\nLondon in 2019."
