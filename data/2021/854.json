It is on the northern edge of the old King's Wood (part of the Great North Wood) and was originally a lodge, built between 1811 and 1814 by William Vizard, a high profile solicitor who became President of the Law Society.",
                "At the end of the 19th century John Lawson Johnston, the creator of Bovril, transformed the lodge into the house that we see today. The architect was Henry Vaughan Lanchester.",

In 1919 it was bought by a shipping and food processing magnate, Sir William Vestey. In 1922 when he was made a lord, Sir William took the title Baron Vestey of Kingswood.",
