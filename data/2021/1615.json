The land was the derelict site where two large houses had once stood. It was unsuitable for conventional house building because of the hills and large trees. The land was offered to people on Lewisham's housing waiting list who were willing to build their own houses. The self-builders had little or no building experience and fitted in construction work at evenings and weekends."

The exterior panels are glyzel board (industrial building cladding) and the interior is plaster board. Newer extensions use resin boards. The layers are held together with wooden strips secured with metal bolts. This gives the houses their distinctive timber beamed interior.",
                "The roof is flat and made from a waterproof membrane, which is held in place by pebbles. The membrane is weighted down but not attached to the building except around the edges. The houses are built on stilts which sit on slabs beneath are concrete piles dug deep into the ground – 6 mtrs! As there are no conventional foundations the houses are unusually close to trees (including a Wellingtonia between numbers 8 and 10) that adds to the rustic feel."

The modular nature and panel construction of the Segal houses means the houses can be extended adapted and rearranged much more readily than conventional brick and mortar houses.",
