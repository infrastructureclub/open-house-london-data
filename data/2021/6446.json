In this interim period we have worked alongside gallery artist and print maker Kristina Chan and João Villas's print studio Plaintiff Press to bring you 10 prints by 10 Artists. A series of unique limited edition prints from 10 of the artists we have worked with since the gallery started. Only sold through the gallery the prints have been carefully selected, refined and printed to form a bespoke and beautiful collection. The prints will be on early release for Open House only - after which they will be released one by one over the coming weeks.",
