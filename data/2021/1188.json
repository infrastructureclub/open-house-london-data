                "The Oak Room survives as part of Sir Hugh Myddelton’s achievement in bringing fresh water to the City of London in 1613, from springs 20 miles to the north in Hertfordshire. The New River he created ended at Clerkenwell, and its construction was a remarkable feat of engineering and a considerable benefit to the population of the City. Water was conveyed to homes through elm pipes leading from the cistern, and the utility was managed by the New River Company set up by Myddelton and his business associates."

                "Above the cistern the Company erected a building to house its supervisors and provide offices and a Water Control Station. Cistern House, later the Water House, contained the Oak Room which was fitted out at the end of the 17th Century. It was intended as a Board Room for meetings of the Governors, and its sumptuous decoration demonstrates the pride and wealth of the Company.",
                "Originally situated on the first floor, it is almost square but has anterooms at each end, each with two entrances. It is panelled in dark oak, with half-columns framing the fireplace and deep window frames. On each side of the fireplace are recessed shelves. Grinling Gibbons, a protege of Wren, was commissioned to do the decorative carving, and the overmantel and panels over the doors and shelving are of the finest quality. They portray water-plants and animals, fish and anglers’ tackle. In the ceiling the oval, gilt-framed portrait of William of Orange celebrates the Treaty of Ryswick of 1697, as does the Royal Arms over the fireplace. Also on the ceiling are the arms of Myddleton and the Company Clerk, John Grene. The ceiling is richly moulded with foliage and birds and delightful tiny scenes of riparian rural life at its edge.",
                "In 1904 the newly formed Metropolitan Water Board bought the Oak Room from the New River Company and installed it in the new Headquarters building designed in 1920 by Austin Hall as New River Head. During the war the Room was dismantled and stored, but it was re-instated in 1945. Now it remains marooned in the building which has been converted into luxury apartments."
