Our first district-scale heat network, it serves over 1,300 homes, two leisure centres and four office blocks. The heat network and energy centre were completed in 2012 and provide cheaper, greener heat to residents. Initially serving 600 homes, it has since been expanded to several other sites, more than doubling the number of residents connected.",
                "The original energy centre houses a 1.9MWe gas CHP engine and a 115m³ thermal store. The network currently consists of 2.5km of trenching with 5km of insulated pipework. The £3.8m energy centre and heat network were funded by grants secured from the GLA and the Homes and Community Agency."

The council undertook upfront work where possible to reduce the project risks and minimise uncertainties during the construction phase, including the design and application for planning and underground surveys. A Design & Build contract was commissioned alongside a 10-year maintenance contract to provide assurance to the contracts. Vital Energi built the energy centre and heat network in 2012."

This approach also creates opportunities for Islington to further expand the heat network and develop other heat networks across the borough, and potentially across borough boundaries."

It provides flexibility, as all the equipment can be lifted out of the site and relocated elsewhere.",
