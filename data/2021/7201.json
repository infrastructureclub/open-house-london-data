                "Built on the site of the Wood Green Empire variety theatre, Page High's red brick was chosen to blend in with its surroundings.",
                "The building won the Good Design in Housing Award, 1976.",
                "Remarkably, the estate is above a car park (Bury Road) that is itself above a retail outlet (originally Sainsbury, now Matalan).",
                "Built by a consortium consisting of Haringey Council, Sainsbury, Woolworth's and World of Housing Property Trust (later Sanctuary Housing), Page High stands as a monument to ambition and good design in social housing.",
                "We’re high up, about six or seven stories. But the estate feels like it’s on the ground. There’s a wide pathway, a veritable street in sky, between the two rows of low-rise buildings that make up most of Page High. Homes consist mostly of one and two room apartments, and maisonettes. Flats have front and back balconies, and 'ground' floor flats have front gardens.",
                "On one side of the estate, we have a magnificent view over to Alexandra Palace. On the other side, the view is over to Noel Park and Tottenham (the Spurs stadium is visible, clearly so when it’s lit up for evening matches).",
                "Many people at Page High have lived on the estate for decades. Their children have grown up here. They have deep ties to the local area. As residents, we’re pleased to be living in historic social housing.",
                "A Tenants' Association was set up in 2017 to improve repairs and maintenance, and campaign for the improvement of the estate.",
                "The Tenants' Association (@PageHighTenants) is pleased to offer two tours on the Saturday.",
                "NB Max. 10 visitors for each tour. No bookings. First come, first served!",
