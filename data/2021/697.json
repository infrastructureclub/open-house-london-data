The Clock Mill opposite was rebuilt in 1817. There was also a third mill, a windmill, which survived until about 1840. The House Mill continued to operate until 1941 and the Clock Mill until 1952."

As part of the work to restore the site, the Miller’s House, which had been demolished in the late 1950s, was reconstructed in 1993/4. The façade was rebuilt to the 1763 design with reused 18th century bricks. Using many of the original materials recovered from the bombed site, the ground floor of the Miller’s House has been reconstructed as original, whilst the rest of the building is a new structure.",
                "The Miller’s House provides a visitor, information, and education centre, with meeting rooms for hire and a small cafe. It was funded by the European Union. In 1996 it won a Civic Trust Commendation for outstanding architecture.",
