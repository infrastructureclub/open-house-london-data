They worked closely with residents from the outset to pick up on earlier threads of consultation and to establish the brief for the project. Interviews and walkarounds with key stakeholders, including a local homeless charity and community garden. This informed the inclusion of a high level planting deck and scaffold ‘trellis’ which overspans the development and rear courtyard, putting gardening activity at the heart of the scheme.",
                "In parallel, and in partnership with workspace operator Meanwhile Space, we visited other community spaces in the borough and local primary schools to build a thorough picture of local demand and operational requirements. Together, we reported regularly to the Community Futures Group to workshop the design. It was their brief to create an ‘invitation’ into the estate that informed the inclusion of an illuminated sculptural tower on the corner of the site to announce the building’s civic function."

                "In light of the building’s limited lifespan, ARUP were commissioned to develop a structural scheme based on pre-fabricated timber cassettes and roof trusses, making innovative use of accessible elements common in house-building. As well as minimising time on site, these  have been carefully assembled to allow the entirety of the structures to be disassembled and re-erected elsewhere. In the case of the workspaces, partial re-erection has also been desgn prepared in case the next site is narrower. Meanwhile, the use of timber (including in the ground floor plates) allows for flexibility in fixing and adaptation and keeps the buildings light, minimising their foundations and embodied carbon. Vertical circulation is provided by a scaffold system, which also frames the rear courtyard of the scheme."
