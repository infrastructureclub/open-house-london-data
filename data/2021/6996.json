It was called Atlas House  – “one of a row of badly built houses ...” with a shop on the ground floor selling china crockery and a special line of cricket goods. He says “We lived mostly downstairs and underground, more particularly in the winter”. He spent the first 13 years of his life there and the house is described in vivid detail in his Autobiography. Many of the buildings he would have known are still standing – including several in the 'Arts and Crafts' style popular in the Victorian era."
