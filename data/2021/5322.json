Water acts as a theme for the architecture theme, connecting all aspects of the Gallery. The displays and the areas around each display have been shaped by the movement of water. Water has created a changeable space, one which people will continue to return to."

The white space of the main gallery is shaped by the continuous logic of the illuminated water drops that seamlessly connects the different areas. The array of glowing ‘pods’ builds the spine of the central space that is further defined with its final spiral move, which leads to the knowledge, research and and multi-media seating area next to the main reception.",
                "The bold spatial concepts of the unique display environments stand out as dark grey concrete in contrast with the white central spine of the Gallery. Their form has been sculpted as if by the properties of erosion combined with the functional considerations of the gallery to allow flexibility. The continuing variety within the five distinct bathroom areas evolves along the backbone of the main Gallery."

The sculptural spaces of the striking 1,100m2 gallery will become the site for an immersive installation of ZHD’s portfolio of pioneering designs, from fashion and jewellery, to home accessories and furniture, carpets and lighting. First time UK exhibits include a new furniture range made in collaboration with Japanese high tech brand Karimoku and jewellery designed for Tateossian.",
                "The collaborative output is well represented in the exhibition, including furniture developed with David Gill Gallery; lighting for Slamp and Lasvit; shoes designed for United Nude and Lacoste; jewellery made for Bulgari and Tateossian; and crystal bowls and vases designed for Lalique.",
                "The objects date back to the founding of the design practice in 2006 and are brought up to the present day with the installation of the 2022 collection of elegant wooden furniture made with Japanese brand Karimoku."
