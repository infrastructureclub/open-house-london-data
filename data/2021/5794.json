                "The two-stage retrofit began on the ground floor, where the architects' studio is located. Having suffered from previous domestic conversions into dark, cramped cellular spaces, the ground floor has been re-opened up into a single horse-shoe shaped space. The design reveals the original Victorian ironworks, wall tiles, timber paneling, cobblestones, etc.",
                "The second stage of the retrofit was the upper maisonette, which has 4 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms on the 1st floor and an open-plan living/kitchen/dining space above. By locating the shared living space on the top floor, all occupants can enjoy the natural daylight provided by the rooflights and dormers.",
                "Leading the design decisions throughout the build was the priority to retain the original Victorian features while making as many carbon-reducing improvements as possible (working towards Code of Sustainable Building Code Level 4):",
