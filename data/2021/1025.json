Works included the re-establishment of the original vistas from the Manor House, the introduction of a walled flower garden, the restoration of the lake and installation of a fountain. In addition the original ice-house has been restored and is open to the public on the first and third Sunday of the month from April to September. Other new features include a popular cafeteria, multi-sports ball court and tennis courts as well as a children's playground.",

                "The ice house is thought to be about 200 years old. It was built in the NW corner alongside other estate buildings under a landscaped mound of earth. The corridor to the ice house would probably have been used as a cold store. Around 1900 it was used as stabling for a local builder's ponies and served as an air raid shelter in WWII. The ice house was restored by architects Timpson Manley for the Lee Manor Society when the gardens received lottery funds to restore its original features."
