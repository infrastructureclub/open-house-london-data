                "In 2021, the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham celebrates 100 years of the Becontree Estate with Becontree Forever, a year-long public programme of art, architecture and new infrastructure. The centenary is an opportunity to celebrate the estate’s groundbreaking and radical beginnings but also to reimagine Becontree’s future. \nIn recognition and celebration of the life of Alderman Fred Jones (who lived in this house) and his contribution to the social, cultural and civic life of Barking and Dagenham, we will be hosting a series of exhibitions about the Becontree Estate, including research work of the London Metropolitan University School of Architecture Studio 4 and Studio 14. The exhibitions will include student research studies, models and interviews. \nStudio 4 Exhibition: Liveness curated by Ludwig Willis Architects will explore notions of settlement and neighbourhood on the Becontree Estate and the idea of the ‘Garden City’ as a juxtaposition of urbanism and wilderness, as opposed to a city of gardens (suburbia). The exhibition showcase’s student research and design proposals for the Becontree Estate.\nStudio 14 Exhibition, curated by Pierre D’Avoine and Pereen D’Avoine will explore the context of the Becontree Estate within Barking and Dagenham’s expansive regeneration programme. The exhibition will focus on student research and design proposals produced over the last three academic years, which explore the making of architecture and an inclusive city; housing, public realm and green spaces incorporating archival documents recognising the life and work of Alderman Councillor Jones and interviews. \nAlderman Jones House will be a place where residents, communities and visitors can come together to reflect on how the Becontree has evolved and debate how it should develop its buildings, streets, parks and neighbourhoods in the future over the month of September.\nFor further details please visit becontreeforever.uk"
