                "The transformation of the 85 acres in Wembley Park, North West London’s world-famous entertainment district now also a 365-day neighbourhood, has been underway for over 15 years. Over the past five years, Quintain  - the team behind the regeneration of Wembley Park - has been working with Dixon Jones Architects, Gross Max Landscape Architects, Tony Kirkham and other expert advisors to deliver an “Avenue of Champion Trees of the World” lining Olympic Way (colloquially known to thousands of visitors as “Wembley Way”).\n \nCompleted in June ahead of UEFA Euro 2020 championships, Olympic Way has been transformed into an approach designed to fully complement the magnificence of the world-famous national stadium and provide an attractive and convenient thoroughfare to Wembley Park.\n \nAs part of this transformation, a site-wide tree planting strategy - in place at Wembley Park since 2005 - has allowed for the planting of 24 matched pairs of trees along Olympic Way, of varying species selected from the temperate zones around the world. The new trees also benefit from a system of specialist root containers which provide the environment for them to thrive.\n \nThe strategy, which won the Trees and Development Award at the 2017 London Tree and Woodland Awards, includes the planting over 830 trees across the neighbourhood.",
                "This number is set to grow, with the unveiling of a new 7-acre public park, which will also feature other amenities such as extensive water features and a new bandstand. Phase 1 of the new park - its Southern section - has now been completed and open to visitors and residents."
