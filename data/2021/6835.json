Ownership then passed through various hands until in 1737, the estate was sold to Sir Hans Sloane, who demolished the main Beaufort House residence.\n \nCount Zinzendorf, a German nobleman, and inspiring leader of the Moravian brethren,  acquired Lindsey House, which is on Cheyne Walk, and the rest of the estate in 1750. He planned to build a major “Settlement“ or model village for the Moravians there, which sadly never happened.",
                "A Chapel and Manse were however built in the former stable yard of Lindsey House, using existing 16th century walls.   The Burial Ground was laid out in typical Moravian fashion.  The focus of the Moravians’ activity moved to Fetter Lane in the City of London, and most of the estate was sold, although the Moravians retained the Close.",
