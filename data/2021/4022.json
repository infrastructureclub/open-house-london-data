The transition from the lobby to the meeting room, through a 180-degree turn and via stepped walls and ceiling heights, encourages a sense of concentration (‘centring down’ in Quaker jargon) and of a progress into light – an important metaphor in Quakerism. In the absence of a minister, altar or other point of focus, seats are normally arranged in a circular or square pattern.",

Quaker meeting houses normally contain no conventional Christian symbols, but the architect here included a discreet croix pattée – well out of reach."

When the Congregational and Presbyterian Churches merged at a national level, the main church building and its hall were sold.",
