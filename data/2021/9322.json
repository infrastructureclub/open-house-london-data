                "Virtual TOUR – The Saints and the City of London walking tour\nIn which Church can you literally see the name of God?\nWhat is a worshipful company?\nWhich saint had a chapel on a bridge?\nThe names of saints adorn the City of London. Veneration of saints filled a gap: saints days replaced many pagan festivals that were previously celebrated. Our virtual tour will use a variety of saints to access the City of London. This is a City of London highlights tour with a difference, let the saints guide us.\nOnce you have experienced your tour you will be able to say you have seen:\nA typical Wren Church\nThe oldest Parish Church in the City\nRelics of the religious orders of Bishopsgate and Blackfriars\nAnd so much more!\nFactoid- It took 33 years to build the first stone London Bridge, and unfortunately the priest-architect Peter de Colechurch died before it was completed. Colechurch was buried in a cavity under the Chapel he built upon the bridge."
