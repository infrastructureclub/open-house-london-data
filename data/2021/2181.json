                "Opened on 28 July 1906, it was the earliest purpose-built open air baths in London, as well as being unusually large (300ft x 100ft). In the 1890s the London County Council had adapted and concreted existing ponds to provide hygienic bathing lakes, but most of these were subsequently replaced by purpose-built baths, known as lidos from the 1930s.",
                "Sited near the LCC's Totterdown Fields Estate (being occupied from 1903) and other contemporary housing, the driving force for the Lido came from Wandsworth Metropolitan Borough when the LCC was reluctant to authorise the expenditure. A compromise was reached: Wandsworth MB would build the pool but the LCC (as owners of Tooting Bec Common) would provide the site and undertake maintenance (estimated at £200 per year).",
                "Labour, mostly unskilled, came from the Central (Unemployed) Body for London who seem to have paid the costs of £4,300 (based initially on 250 men at 7d per hour for ten weeks) – and the Board believed the labourers were \"improved in physique, capacity and zeal\".",
                "Wandsworth paid £3,400 for the building materials, plans and site supervision, and the design was provided by H J Marten, District Surveyor for Wandsworth Eastern District, and supervision completed by Mr Dodd, the Western District Surveyor.",
                "The bottom and sides were concreted with Portland cement, plugged with bituminous sheeting. The surrounds were flagged with stone and a 'dressing shed' of corrugated iron was erected along the eastern side. Excavated soil was formed into an embankment (planted with trees in 1906) to shield the pond from the common."

The dressing sheds were adapted as individual cubicles and new changing rooms, with individual doors and seats, plus new lavatories, were added. These changes were made so that mixed bathing could take place in the Lido. In 1936 a café was built and the lavatories remodelled. All these designs were from the LCC Parks Department."

More cycle parking was created on the right hand side of the entrance. Windows were created to provide views into the historic plant room, allowing the machinery that provides clean water to be seen and appreciated, with an explanation of the science and history of water filtration. And the iconic cubicles were refurbished, with new cubicles added, including a wide one for families and wheelchair users.",
