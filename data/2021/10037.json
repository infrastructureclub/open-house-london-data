This was the first time they had the opportunity to design a space for their business, and they felt a little lost.",
                "Together with them, we analysed their offering and unique clientele. We immediately realised the amazing potential there was to create something special and guided them through a process that included not only the design of their new studio, but also a more wholistic undertaking that led to a new and stronger definition of their brand, logo and aesthetic ethos."

                "The brief had extensive requirements for both large Reformer Pilates machines and a great deal of storage for all the props required for the sessions. On top of that, a reception area, two changing rooms and a toilet were required. With the total size being of less than 80 square meters we were faced with a major challenge to make it all fit. The budget was tight, and the timeframe was constrained."

                "The brief was extensive and the space small, so we worked hard to come up with a layout that would host most of the requirements in a very small space, leaving as much free area as possible for the exercise floor and the large machines.",
                "The owners of the Studio are a lovely Mexican-Norwegian couple, so we wanted the design to include references to their backgrounds.",
                "In order to reduce the amount of visual clutter and create a luxurious and very calm and relaxing feel, we designed most elements to be built bespoke, with inexpensive but highly durable materials. The design includes clever concealed storage solutions that are playful and beautiful to look at."

                "The materials chosen offer different tactile experiences that help bring the awareness fully back onto the body after an exercise session in the studio.",
                "The studio feels luxurious even though it was built on a budget, and the result feels warm and far from the standard commercial and colder feel of most gyms and Pilates studios."
