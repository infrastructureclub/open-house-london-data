The top floor has an inward falling roof that creates two small courtyards for members to enjoy. D3 will be completed after the Silvertown Tunnel has been built."

HNNA has won a string of major international design competitions and was recently commissioned to design the Iraq Parliament and sustainable, human-centric housing for The United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat). Having worked on the Peninsula-wide masterplan here in North Greenwich, HNNA designed and developed the masterplan for the Design District and is also its design coordinator."
