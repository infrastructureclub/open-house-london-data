                "St Lawrence Whitchurch has a stone built tower that dates back to medieval times (c.1360). The church was rebuilt in a unique Continental Baroque style in 1715 by James Brydges, the first Duke of Chandos.\n \nThe walls and ceiling of the dramatic interior are covered with paintings by French and Italian artists. The panels on the ceiling show miracles taken mostly from St John’s Gospel. The ceiling above the altar depicts the Adoration of Jehovah. Behind the altar is an imitation sky lit by a concealed window which is characteristic of the baroque of continental Europe. The tradition and style suggests that the whole of the ceiling was painted by Louis Laguerre. The paintings of the Nativity and the Descent from the Cross, which are seen on either side of the altar, and the Transfiguration, which is above the Duke’s Pew, are attributed to Antonio Bellucci.",
                "Most of the interior woodwork is original and is attributed to Grinling Gibbons. This includes the organ case which is carved with cherubs, pea pods and other typical Grinling Gibbons decorations. The famous composer George Frideric Handel was employed by the Duke of Chandos around 1717-18 as composer in residence. Handel composed eleven Chandos Anthems for the Duke and these were almost certainly performed in the church.",
                "On the north side of the church is the Mausoleum built to the order of the Duke of Chandos. The centrepiece is a monument to the first Duke in anything but a humble style!"

                "St Lawrence was a deacon in Rome in the mid Third Century AD. On 6 August 258, he became the senior ranking Church official, following the execution of Pope St Sixtus II. His tenure of this position did not last long, as he was summoned for beheading on the 10th, and was commanded to bring the riches of the church with him.",
                "Lawrence had already given away the church's wealth, and arrived with a crowd of the poor, blind, sick and crippled –which were the church's true riches.",
                "St Lawrence was martyred on a griddle, and is reputed to have told his murderers to turn him over, as he was\" done on that side\". It is perhaps unsurprising that he is known as a patron saint of cooks and restauranteurs.\n \nThe feast of his martyrdom falls at the time of the Perseid Meteor shower. This spectacular astromonical phenomenon was known in past times as the \"burning tears of St Lawrence\".",
