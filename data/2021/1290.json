It is the practical embodiment of an idea conceived by a young man John Evelyn Wrench who saw what was then the British Empire not merely as a political and economic structure but as a 'far flung brotherhood of individual men and women of diverse creeds and races living under differing conditions in different latitudes'. He sought to encourage friendship and understanding between them.",

Vernon House and Rutland House were extended in 1937 over what was once the courtyard and ballroom of Rutland House."
