                "The Homerton Library (now Chats Palace Arts Centre) was opened by the Mayor of Hackney, the Chief Librarian and other dignitaries on 31 May 1913.  Funded by the Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie it is one of the 660 Carnegie libraries built in the UK under his patronage in the period 1883 to 1929.",
                "Designed by the architect Edwin Cooper (who also designed Clapton Library) the Homerton Library was built for the “betterment of the people of the East End”.  Its parquet floors, glass roof with leaded lights, original features including a marble floor and pillared frontage are a testament to the care and eye for detail that the architect had for the building.",
                "Where we now have our theatre space was the adult library – a dramatic double height space with a gallery balcony and reading rooms on all side.  The Edwardian glass atrium, which flooded the space with natural light, now forms the ceiling of our first-floor rehearsal Studio, created from the later insertion of a mezzanine level.  Our Theatre Bar was the Children’s Library and the wood that forms the bar counter is the original wood from the librarian’s desk. The iconic frontage, with its beautiful leaded windows, remains unaltered to this day.",
                "In the mid 1970s a new Homerton Library was built on Homerton High Street and the Old Homerton Library closed. Following a march by a group of local activists, who then occupied the site, Chats Palace Arts Centre opened in 1976 and swiftly became a focus for community activity.",
                "Supported by Hackney Council and GLA, it housed the Hackney Marsh Festival, Silk Screen printing and a crèche as well as a professional amateur arts programme, including the now- legendary Chats Palace Christmas Show.  As part of the conversation process, a mezzanine floor was built into the adult library to create a creative studio space and the windows of the library were covered to create the Black Box theatre space that we have today."
