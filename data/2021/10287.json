                "The Studios were created in 1995 by the Arts Team in Hounslow, by converting the old stables building in Redlees Park. Some years later, with support from The Arts Council and Lottery funding, the upper floor of the building was converted into usable studio spaces. The building can accommodate up to 34 artists working in individual and in shared spaces.\n \nOn the ground floor there is an accessible gallery used regularly for exhibitions, workshops and classes.  Twice a year the artists open their doors and invite the public to a weekend of Open Studios.  You can visit them in their working spaces and enjoy the opportunity of discovering contemporary art, and buy or commission directly from the artists.",
