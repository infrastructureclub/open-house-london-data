Initially called the Bethnal Green Ladies Committee with Her Royal Highness Princess Marie Adelaide, Duchess of Teck, as President. St. Margaret's was a substantial house with 15 rooms in a square built around the Museum Green. It was formally opened in October 1889."

                "Eleven years later in December 1900, it was decided to buy number 21 Old Ford Road, which belonged to the Females Guardians Association. Arrangements were made to find the necessary £3,600 to buy this Georgian town house of character and charm.",

It had fourteen residents including the Head and Bursar, six lodgers engaged in teaching or social work, two medical students and one Charity Organisation Society worker. The start of a club for young married women stressing education for citizenship, rather than recreation,  proved to be very popular.",
                "In 1924, St. Margaret's House started a children's play hours scheme twice a week in the large hall which accommodated over 50 children who would otherwise be roaming the streets of Bethnal Green. In the same year, the house took a leading part in launching the local branch of the Industrial Christian Fellowship.",

In 1934, during the worst period of unemployment in the East End, the Unemployed Men's Centre was opened. Around the same time, St. Margaret's House was also sending out food parcels to old-age pensioners and the very poor.",
                "In 1938 new initiative schemes such as the Hospital Savings Association and Penny Bank were set up. In the same year a gas-proof room was constructed due to the threat of war."

Fortunately, however, St. Margaret's House escaped serious damage, despite much broken glass and several near misses. This includes an incendiary bomb which fell on the chapel roof and failed to ignite.",
                "In 1953 the council decided that men could live at St. Margaret's House as well as women, due to declining numbers of female students wishing to take up residence at the house. In 1959 extensive repair and improvements were made to the main house: a new roof and rewiring throughout. In 1961 a new initiative, an introductory course for voluntary workers was commenced.",
                "Throughout the 1960s and 70s St. Margaret's House faced financial ups and downs due to a desire to help the local community and limited finances. But a visit by the poet laureate, Sir John Betjeman, in 1975, assisted in raising enough money to help it through the financial crisis."
