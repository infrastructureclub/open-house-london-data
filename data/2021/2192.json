The design and quality of construction and detailing far surpasses anything in Hampstead Garden Suburb, the most well known of the London Garden Suburbs.",

This was followed by Welwyn Garden City in 1919.  Before 1909 planning covered by local by-laws only and was chaotic.  Grenbelt and ‘zoning’ developed and wide avenues containing public and shopping spaces, including allotment gardens which helped to bridge the gap between town and country."

                "At the turn of the century Tottenham was a village-suburb served by new railways and at the end of the tramlines. It was surrounded by fields, which the newly formed London County Council (LCC) could acquire using as yet hardly used powers to buy land and build Council Housing.",
                "Earlier experiments in housing design for workers had produced beautiful picturesque estates modelled on traditional rural housing, such as Port Sunlight in Cheshire, Bourneville and New Earswick near York. They were designed by some of the most progressive architects of their day and funded by rich social reformers. Their architectural philosophy respected co-operation between architects and craftsmen and was called the ‘Arts and Crafts Movement’.",
                "Under the LCC, Britain was to pioneer and lead the world in planned social housing. The LCC wanted to improve housing conditions for the working classes by providing well-constructed, healthful homes in pleasant surroundings for rent.",
                "The provision of local authority housing to supply the needs of working people only became possible following an 1885 Royal Commission Enquiry into the provision of housing for working people. The result was the 1890 Housing of the Working Classes Act. Part 3 of the Act, for the first time, gave general powers to local authorities to build housing for the needs of working people.",
                "The LCC did not decide to use its radical Part 3 powers until 1898 when Ebenezer Howard published ‘Tomorrow – A peaceful path to real reform’. This was the book, which launched the Garden City movement and Town Planning."

Samuel the jeweller was a cousin, donated £10,000 to purchase land and build at lower density to provide accommodation in a ‘garden suburb’ setting. He founded Montagu bank in 1853 and the Federation of Synagogues. The donation tied to the rehousing of Jewish workers resident in the Tower Hamlets parish, and required an area of land to be set aside for public gardens: hence the name Tower Gardens."

Tower Gardens was also the first LCC estate to be built outside the LCC area. Tower Gardens was the foremost housing achievement of the early London County Council. It demonstrates the unequalled idealism, boldness and scale of operation of the early LCC under the Progressive Party, whose political will brought together the professional skills and financial resources to undertake such large scale social housing projects.",
                "Now that Council Housing Estates are being sold off or transferred to housing associations, the special historic importance of the Tower Gardens experiment can be reassessed. Its survival largely intact to the present day, together with its architectural quality have given it special importance worthy of the most vigorous measures towards its conservation."
