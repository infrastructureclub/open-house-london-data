Previously the rear of the house was dark and disjointed and lacking in storage.  Access to the garden was convoluted and a leaky fabric meant the house was constantly cold.\nAs an architect designing my own home extension, with a fixed budget, I wanted to create something simple, but carefully crafted, with a key attention to detail."

The roof is pitched towards the edge of the existing outrigger and is expressed internally with a vaulted ceiling to the rear.  This gives a wonderful volume to the dining area with a rooflight perfectly framing the neighbouring bamboo and sky.\nThe ceiling remains flat to the side return  This results in a  deep shaft of light created by the opening rooflight on this side.\nThe extension is kept separate from the main house by the creation of a small courtyard lightwell.  This brings light to the centre of the plan on both sides and simplifies the plumbing, allowing the original house to breathe."

The aluminium sliding doors and windows have a soft beige colour that blends with the pale Weinerberger brickwork.  The brick is continued inside the extension so that many of the materials are self finished.\nThe roof is clad in Pigmento Red zinc which is picked up in the soft red clay pavers.  The soft earthy tones are offset with a bright green kitchen linking to the garden beyond."
