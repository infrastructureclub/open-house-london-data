                "Next, we source malts and fill our Grist case with fresh malt from our UK suppliers.",
                "Then, the malt goes into our mash tun and mixed with water from our hot liquor tank. We then run water through to extract all the sugars from the malt. The resulting mixture is called ‘wort’.",
                "The wort goes through to a giant kettle, where the wort is mixed with fresh hops. Hops added during this time provide the bitterness in the beer, essential for creating a ‘balance’.",
                "From the kettle, the resulting liquid is sent to our whirlpool. Inside the whirlpool, the liquid is spun around and the solids present in the liquid (such as hops and malt residues) slowly collect in the middle, resulting in a clear(er) liquid.",
                "Next, we chill the liquid through our heat exchanger. We run cold water on one side, causing the liquid to reduce in temperature while the plain water is heated for the next brew, all in the same process. Crash chilling it from it’s 90C to roughly 18C is important for the next step when we pitch the yeast.",
                "Lastly, we pitch the yeast in the tank so that the fermentation process can begin. Our millions of little workers work 24 hours a day to convert the sugars into alcohol. This process can last anywhere between 2 to 7 days depending on the strength of the beer.",
                "After the beer has fermented, we process the beer by fining and filtering it, ready for casking/bottling/kegging."
