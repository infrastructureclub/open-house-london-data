                "This socially distanced walking tour explores the flourishing art scene of London's South Bank, from Bermondsey to Vauxhall. This insightful walk led by Evgenia Petrova tells the story of art and architecture, their interplay and influence on each other, and how ideas of an art space have developed and taken shape in our times. The tour will cover buildings designed as art spaces, those that have been repurposed to be used as art spaces and those taken over by the public to be art spaces. \n \nLandmark buildings featured on the tour include the Hayward Gallery, Tate Modern, White Cube Gallery, Newport Street Gallery, Leake Street Arches, Cabinet Gallery and the Fashion and Textile Museum.",
                "Route notes: The route is mostly flat, however there are some steps and stairs around Hayward Gallery and Royal Festival Hall. Leake Street has a flat but uneven surface. This tour will cover some ground (approx 6.5km of walking).",
                "Guide: Evgenia Petrova is a director at a boutique property consultancy Soames in Chelsea, London. She is a published author having co-authored a book on body language and holds a BSc in psychology from Goldsmiths. She is passionate about arts and culture and is particularly interested in exploring how art influences and takes shape in the built environment."
