Starting in 1951 with the Festival of Britain, this 90-minute walking tour will chart the key moments of the past 70 years and point to important dynamics influencing the area’s future and recovery from the Covid pandemic.  With a focus on how the South Bank’s unique location and pattern of land ownership has shaped its history, development, architecture, the tour will address how businesses, communities, and local people have played a part in the area’s growth, management, and conservation.",
