                "Peek Frean’s was established in 1857 by founding partners James Peek and George Hender Frean. The original site of the bakery was on Mill Street in Dockhead. However, due to a sustained period of growth, Peek Frean’s outgrew the Mill Street Site within nine years. After a fire burnt the original site to the ground, in 1873 the factory moved to this larger site on Clements Road.\n \nDuring its long history, Peek Frean’s introduced some of the most recognisable biscuits of today. Popular and notable biscuits include the ‘Garibaldi’ – one of the oldest biscuits which was introduced in 1861; the ‘Marie’ biscuit, which was created to celebrate the marriage of Queen Victoria’s second son, Prince Alfred to the Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna in 1874. \n \nThe ‘Bourbon’ (originally known as the ‘Creola’) followed in 1910; and the ‘Shortcake’ came to market in 1912. Both Twiglets and Cheeselets were created at Peak Frean’s during the inter-war period. All are still household favourites today. \n \nAfter 123 years, the Peek Frean’s factory closed its doors in 1989 – having made biscuit production history in the local area, earning it the nickname “Biscuit Town”."

                "Building F is a former warehouse building, constructed around 1970 by an unknown architect. The existing building was used primarily for storage purposes until the factory’s closure in the late 1980s. \n \nBiscuits were produced in an adjacent factory facility and brought up to the second floor of Building F for packing. The ground floor was used as a warehouse, and the delivery and loading area was at the western end of the building. \n \nToday the ground floor storage room, with its triple height space, remains accessible. Original architectural features, including windows along the northern façade, are still visible. Former staff terraces on the third floor, with their unimpeded view of the city skyline, will be open as part of the Open House tour of the building."

                "The former biscuit factory warehouse building is part of a wider redevelopment of the area being delivered by Grosvenor Britain & Ireland.  The development will include a new school, 1,548 rental homes, alongside over 10,000 sqm of office and 10,000 sqm of retail, leisure, cultural and community spaces. New public yards, playscapes and squares are also being built.  The intention is to develop a place infused with the history of Bermondsey that involves and connects communities.\n \nBuilding F is part of the first phase, and demolition has started on site. This original warehouse structure will be retained and extended upwards. The industrial character of the building will be evident in chosen finishes and maintenance of the triple height warehouse space at ground level. When complete, Building F will include a retail/market area on the ground floor, residential flats for rent and two floors of offices. The dramatic 3rd floor roof terrace will be opened to the public for all to enjoy."
