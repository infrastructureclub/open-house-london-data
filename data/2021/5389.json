In addition, the South East London Combined Heat and Power (SELCHP) energy recovery facility, where a large portion of Southwark’s waste is processed, is located just a mile away from the site.",

The bees help to pollinate local foliage but also produce our delicious Old Kent Road honey!"

                "The MRF sorts one of the widest ranges of household recyclables in the UK, including difficult to recycle items such as Tetra Paks, aerosols and tubs. It can be reprogrammed to take account of future developments in packaging and materials, ensuring a more sustainable design – a first in Europe. Near Infrared (NIR) sorters are used extensively to reduce the human interface within the mechanical separation process, making the facility safer and more efficient than ever.",
                "The MBT treats black bag, traditionally non-recyclable waste. Using a unique combination of novel technologies, a new concept has been developed to mechanically separate recyclable materials (e.g. metals and plastics) from the general waste. These materials are sent for recycling, whilst the remaining general waste is biologically processed into a low carbon biomass fuel for energy recovery.  Some of this fuel is used at SELCHP to generate electricity for the national grid and heat, which is circulated to around 2,800 Southwark Council homes."
