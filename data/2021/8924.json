                "The house contains a breadboard collection amassed by Rosslyn Neave, an antique dealer, over 40 years. When she was no longer able to live independently, her daughter refurbished the house and created a breadboard gallery in the front room, to keep her mother busy and in touch with her past passions. Rosslyn spent her last few years at home enjoying her collection. After she passed away, her daughter was again faced with what to do about the Mother Clutter. Too raw to sell it, she thought throwing it open to the public might be an uplifting way to share her mother's quirky achievement."

                "The 300+ items are an extraordinary testament to Rosslyn's acquisitiveness, but also to Wood Artistry. They display an eye-watering array of mastery in wood-carving technique, and creativity of design. They date from 1848 – our earliest dateable piece – to this year, as we showcase the innovative creations of Tom Samuel of London.",
                "They are grouped in various ways, some in themes such as 'Homely Mottos' or 'Religion'; others by style 'In the Style of Grinling Gibbons' or 'Art Deco'; still others by workshop, the most preeminent of which were 'William Gibbs Rogers' of London and 'George Wing' of Sheffield.",
                "Breadboards spear-headed a wood revival in the the 1850s which spawned a large array of table accessories such as bread knives, pot stands, egg trays etc. which are also on display."

                "Rosslyn's daughter, Madeleine, has created more of an 'experience' than a museum in the crusty sense of the word. It has evolved over the the three years the museum has been open, but was inspired by Madeleine's concept of an ideal museum. The resulting tour is a quirky fusion of meet-the-curator, antique shop and tea room; visitors drive the tour by asking the questions, are able to handle the collection and polish it all off with a cream tea!"

It was followed by a more respectful write up in The Times, a letter in the Daily Telegraph, and a splash in Metro and the Evening Standard. Breadboards seem to inspire bakers and makers, stylists and collectors, so the ABM has been mentioned in numerous special interest magazines and blogs. Their strong connection with Sheffield earned them a DPS in The Sheffield Star and Telegraph, and an upcoming talk at Kelham Island!",
                "Students of journalism and documentaries have woven the museum into their coursework, and we are glad to be part of a new project with the University of Leicester, 'What can big museums learn from little museums?'"

It crystallises the best of the collection and 20 years' research carried out by Rosslyn, whose dearest wish was to bring it all to print. Tom Samuel contributed an enormous amount to the background and captions, while Marie Lester, a visitor to the museum, volunteered the recipes, styled on our boards. The fab photography is thanks to Unica Art Services."
