                "Once known as Smallberry Green, now the area takes its name from Spring Grove House one time home to Sir Joseph Banks.  The vision of subsequent owner Henry Daniel Davies was for a grand Victorian suburb within some 300 acres of land.  Examples of these Italianate influenced villas designed by John Taylor Jnr survive.  Davies later lived in the largest of the houses he conceived called Thornbury, now Campion House derived from ownership by the Society of Jesus 1911-2005.  Today this grand stuccoed mansion is bordered by a public open space.",
                "Listed Spring Grove House was described in 1840 as a \"fine square building of brick covered with Roman cement, terrace along the south front and walks leading to extensive lawns and a lake\".  It was enlarged and altered during later ownership by Andrew Pears great grandson of the inventor of Pears' transparent soap.  The music room and winter garden are considered fine examples of late 19thC rooms.",
                "Among newer additions to the area is a swathe of quirky arts and crafts semi-detached rough cast and tile hung properties.   While the Crown Court's 1990s extension is an add-on to former ward blocks of a hostel built 1948as a home for paraplegics."
