                "The current church is the third incarnation of St Benet Fink, the first two being in the City of London. The first record dates to 1216. The name refers not to a saint named Benet Fink but rather to St Benedict, the father of Western monasticism, and Robert Fink, the benefactor responsible for the original church's construction.",
                "The medieval church was located on the site now occupied by the Royal Exchange and, along with 88 other churches in the City, it burned down during the Great Fire of 1666. The second incarnation, on the same site, was designed by Sir Christopher Wren and stood until 1846. It was in this church that St John Henry Newman was baptised in 1801.",
                "By the mid-nineteenth century, the population of the City of London had dwindled to such an extent that a large number of its ancient churches were deemed redundant. Upon its demolition, the old parish was combined with St Peter-le-Poer, and the proceeds from the sale of the site were used towards the construction of the present church.",
                "In 1904, a mission to this part of Tottenham was established and a so-called Tin Tabernacle dedicated to St Luke was opened in Granger Road while funds were raised for the current building. Designed by J S Alder and built during 1911 and 1912, at its consecration, the Bishop of London referred to the third incarnation of St Benet Fink as 'the little cathedral'. The church has remained substantially unaltered throughout the past century."
