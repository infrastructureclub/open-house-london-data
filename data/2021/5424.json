                "We have just received planning approval for our 10 year masterplan to undertake a programme of works to help us realise our ambitions to create a community space  with facilities for all. We will:\n* Construct a beautiful new bridge to span the mouth of Cody Dock\n* Remove fences that currently block public access and create a new right of way\n* Create over 200m of new footpaths and community gardens\n* Install riverside lighting and seating",
                "Why it's a great idea:\nAs one of London’s most neglected public spaces, the southern section of the Lower Lea Valley is ripe for redevelopment, not to mention being a region rich with industrial history.",
                "The derelict dock currently acts as the sole barrier connecting an amazing pedestrian green corridor which runs along the Lea from Hertfordshire, through Waltham Abbey and the Olympic Park, before ending at London’s only lighthouse at the confluence with the Thames.",
                "An array of wildlife rarely seen in metropolitan regions already calls the neglected dockland home. We want to start attracting human residents too.",
                "Our medium-term plan for a range of live/work spaces straddling the dock, aims to transform an industrial wasteland into a cutting-edge creative hub inspired by its raw history.",
                "With a growing volunteer force committed to the dock’s regeneration, this project will help Newham, London’s most transitory borough, become the kind of place where people want to put down roots.",
                "How we'll get it done:\n* Commission Sarum Hardwood Structures Ltd to design and build our bridge\n* Prepare the ground and install the foundations with our volunteers\n* Sarum’s team will install the bridge with the help of our volunteers\n* Invite local people, schools and community groups to take on a garden plot\n* Provide professional support and materials to enable voluntary groups to help landscape the site.\n* Organise weekend workshops in permaculture, urban bee keeping and wildlife habit creation",
                "This project is the first phase of our vision to turn the dock into a vibrant hub for the arts and marina for London’s under-served boating community.",
                "The ultimate plan involves building a mix of affordable studio space beside the marina, nurturing a new home for East London’s creative community, which is increasingly priced out of the market. The 2.5 acre site would also feature a visitor centre, café and exhibition space."
