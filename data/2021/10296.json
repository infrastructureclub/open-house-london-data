                "We developed a proposal that bring flowers, food and good times, to this currently unoccupied yard adjacent to one of London’s busiest stations.\nThe proposal assembles simple proprietary parts - heavy duty precast planter pots, green wall cable systems, scaffolding rigging, flowering creepers and climbers, and an elegant Kiosk, to create a public garden offering a cornucopia of delights. It extends the wonderful garden at Gibbon’s rent further out into the street.",
                "As word spreads about the kiosk that all food lovers need to discover, the vines will be growing up the face of No.7 Holyrood Street, providing an enticing flash of green for those coming into London Bridge by train.",
                "The yard at No. 7 has been designed to allow a long Kiosk to face out towards Holyrood Street. Behind the Kiosk, with openings on Gibbon’s Rent and Holyrood Street, is a WC and storage space for bins, beer garden tables and benches. This useful provision will not only allow the Kiosk to provide seating for alfresco meals, but also to act as a custodian to the street by providing basic services for other kiosks and food stalls to join the party when the time is right."
