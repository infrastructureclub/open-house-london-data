                "Boston Manor House is a Jacobean Manor House, built in 1622-3. There was a Tudor mansion on site previously, but it was cleared to build the current house. \nThe House has large park grounds (28-30 acres) which are currently undergoing development through a separate National Lottery Heritage Funded project.\n \nQueen Elizabeth I granted Boston Manor to Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester who immediately sold it to Sir Thomas Gresham, an internationally wealthy merchant and financier who had also bought Osterley as his summer residence. He later founded the Royal Exchange.\n \nAs Gresham died without children, the property went to his stepson (Sir William Reade) who lived in Osterley so had to obtain a Patent of Possession in 1610 from James I so that he could inherit. He married Mary Goldsmith who built Boston Manor House in 1622â€“3, immediately after Sir William Reade's death.\nShe then married Sir Edward Spencer of Althorp, who gained ownership and appears to have bought out the claim of the late William Reade's heirs so that, upon her death in 1658, the lands passed to Lady Mary's heir, John Goldsmith.\nIn 1670, his executors sold Boston Manor House to another very wealthy city merchant: James Clitherow I and the Clitherow family owned Boston Manor from 1670-1922",
                "John Bourchier Stracey-Clitherow was the last private owner of Boston Manor. The House and the surrounding 20 acres was purchased by the Brentford Urban District Council and opened as a public park in 1924."

                "Phase 1 of the regeneration project which focuses on Boston Manor House is now in delivery. Capital works started on 15 July 2019. \nThis phase is a two-year project, supported by The National Lottery Heritage Fund, Historic England, Greater London Authority (GLA) Good Growth Fund, the Wolfson Foundation, the Pilgrim Trust, the Heritage of London Trust and the John and Ruth Howard Trust, to restore and improve access at the Grade I listed historic house. For the safety of the public during the building works, there will be a fence around the works site and there will be no public access to the Park via the gated entrances immediately next to the House.\nOnce the Capital stage of the project is finished (estimated to be later this year), the Activity stage will begin (early 2022-May 2024) and the house will re-open to the public. There will be a new lift to ensure all areas of the house are accessible, a new cafe and the service wing will house several Maker Space studios for creatives to work on site.\nThere will be historic rooms open for visitors to enjoy, as well as a programme of tours, events and workshops throughout the year."
