                "From its consecration in October 1888, the  Church of Our Most Holy Redeemer has been a bastion of the Anglo-Catholic tradition in the Church of England. Beginning as a mission church founded from Saint Philip’s, Granville Square on the site of the Countess of Huntingdon's Spa Fields Chapel, the building was not to be of the popular 'cheap Gothic' type, but rather 'stately and impressive, uplifting the minds and hearts of those who dwelt beneath its shadow'. And so the first vicar, Father Eyre, recruited the architectural talents of John Dando Sedding, architect of several notable London churches including Holy Trinity, Sloane Street. The church interior was modelled upon Brunelleschi's famous church of Santo Spirito in Florence and the exterior given the feel of an Italian basillica, with its gabled front, generous eaves and deep cornice as well as the Latin inscription, 'Christo Liberatori' (To Christ the Redeemer).\nExternally, the church has changed much from its initial appearance with the addition of the Clergy House and campanile on the south side in 1906, and that of the Institute building, containing the parish hall and what were once nuns' cells and rooms for the 'bettering of the poor', on the north side in 1916. The plans for both were drawn up by Henry Wilson, who had collaborated with Sedding on the original design and who went on to oversee all the subsequent additions for nearly 50 years, thus giving the building a remarkable unity."

The structure is in fact mainly wooden, as were the original steps and sanctuary floor - the marble steps and floor were not installed until 1938 in preparation for the 50th anniversary celebrations. The capitals on the columns are the work of F. W. Pomeroy who established a fair reputation as a sculptor. The figure of Christ  which now surmounts the baldachino, was designed by Wilson in 1927 as a memorial to Father Eyre and originally stood where the Altar of Our Lady of Walsingham now stands. The original design had the figure seemingly dancing off a wooden cross, but the figure alone was raised to its present position after the Second World War."

Previously a temporary wall existed along the line of the back of the baldachino and the chapel arches. The reredos and altar steps were added in 1909 and the wooden panelling in 1930, while the altar itself, designed by G. E. Sedding, was dedicated in 1913 for the 25th anniversary festival. The statues of Saint Pancras and the Blessed Virgin Mary, which now flank the altar, represented the Guilds that the church organised for children."
