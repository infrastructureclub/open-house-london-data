                "This new town on the south eastern edges of London offered a leap forward into what was seen as futuristic 21st Century-style living to both residents and visitors alike. Among its most famous visitors was director Stanley Kubrick, who filmed iconic scenes from his cult classic film A Clockwork Orange on the newly built estate in 1970. Since Kubrick, Thamesmead has continued to attract filmmakers, providing a compelling backdrop for urban storytelling. With the estate now undergoing an £8 billion redevelopment, this walking tour revisits its original design intentions and by focusing on film offers a unique re-reading of its landscape to reveal its multiple identities and its enduring humanity.",
                "Route notes: Moderately hilly in places and we will also be walking up steps at a few points in the tour to access the first floor pedestrian walkways and cross roads. The walk is just under 4.5km.",
                "Guide: Áine Grace is originally from Belfast where she studied Architecture at Queens University. Her work had a strong focus on urbanism and film. She is particularly interested in human interactions and attitudes to cities and how we inhabit them and has recently made a short film based on the theme of getting lost in London."
