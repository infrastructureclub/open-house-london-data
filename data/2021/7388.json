                "Blackbook is part of a dynamic and growing wine scene in London, and we are wholly focused on producing English quality wines. Urban wineries are fast becoming commonplace in major cities around the world. An urban winery sources its grapes from a variety of growers and produces all wine on its site. We source our grapes from carefully selected English growers in order to produce still and sparkling single vineyard English wines.",
                "Our concentration is on Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, with some additional varietals included each year. We follow a traditional winemaking approach with low sulphur wines and indigenous ferments as a means to preserve the varietal character. \n \nOur inaugural harvest was 2017 and the first wines were released in 2018. Since release we have won numerous medals, and extended our range to still and sparkling wine.\n \nOur winemaker, Sergio, is a graduate of Plumpton College, who cut his teeth working for some of the world’s top wine producers (California, New Zealand, Burgundy, South Africa and England).",
                "We welcome visitors to the winery on select dates throughout the year for tours and tastings, as well as host private events and welcome volunteers during harvest time."
