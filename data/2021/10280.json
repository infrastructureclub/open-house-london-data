                "Wandering around the heart of Clerkenwell in central London, you may well glimpse an intriguing complex of buildings hiding in plain sight between Roseberry Avenue and Amwell Street.",
                "This is New River Head, a site with a history of engineering innovation dating from the 17th century; a time when London’s rapidly growing population called for a new approach to the supply of water.",
                "From 1609-1613 the New River was made; an aqueduct cut by 200 labourers to enable fresh water from springs in Hertfordshire to flow to a reservoir at New River Head. From there it was distributed to paying customers in the City in overground wooden pipes.",
                "As demand for water in west London grew at the beginning of the 18th century, pumping technology was needed to increase the pressure of the water and enable it to travel beyond the City. The buildings that exist at New River Head today were built to house these changing technologies. \nAt first, a six-sail windmill was used to pump water from the site, but after it was badly damaged by a storm in 1720, the building was converted into a horse gin. Today, the base of the windmill remains, and is the oldest construction of its kind in central London.",
                "In 1768, the site’s first engine house, designed by John Smeaton, was constructed. Extensions were made to accommodate bigger engines in 1786 and 1795, designed by architect and engineer Robert Mylne. A boiler house and coal store were added in 1848, designed by William Chadwell Mylne . All these structures stand today, however with the installation of electric power on the site in the 1950s, the engines were removed and the building’s iconic chimney was demolished.",
                "Now, after decades lying derelict, House of Illustration has acquired the site and plans to renovate and reopen it in 2024 as the Quentin Blake Centre for Illustration; a cultural and architectural landmark with galleries, learning spaces, landscaped gardens, a café and shop.",
                "Turning a derelict heritage site into a new public space is not without its challenges. An architectural competition at the start of 2019 led to the appointment of Tim Ronalds Architects, whose previous projects include Wilton’s Music Hall and Hackney Empire. The practice’s approach of opening up important heritage buildings while keeping their history visible will be the guiding principle of their work on New River Head."
