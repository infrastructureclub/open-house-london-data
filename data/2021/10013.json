Established in 1992 we now have 200 trees on site, a half of which are fruit or nut, and another 100 donated to local schools and scouts. It is planted in a natural style to create a woodland and a delightful oasis. Produce is shared between participants. We are aligned with the philosophy of the National Forest Gardening Scheme.",
