Pitt Cottage, 1936, is in Arts and Crafts vernacular revival cottagey style, while flat roofed, squared off Chatham House 1933 in brown brick with green paintwork (the original colour) represents the Art Deco/Modern Movement. Bowling Green House with its green pantiles is in a more Spanish style.",

Originally fronting the main road to Portsmouth, the 10 Tudor-esque blocks stand around central tennis courts reflecting the 1930s fixation with health but with, nevertheless, underground garaging for the car-owning residents. Aimed at an upmarket clientele, the show flats were furnished by Liberty’s.",
