The structure is bolted together and applied elements – i.e. SIP panels, cladding, timber decking, steel balustrades - can all be easily disassembled.",
                "The use of a prefabricated CLT-steel frame creates large column free spaces that facilitate flexible and adaptive configuration of internal layouts and MEP to suit tenant demands. A demountable partition system has been used throughout, meaning that office space can be reconfigured overnight as needs change. The building can adapt and evolve as required, providing individuals with a high level of ownership over their workspace and the ability to curate it to meet their needs."

Embodied carbon emissions are caused by the extraction and production of building materials and any emissions caused during construction. They also include emissions from maintaining and replacing any elements throughout the whole life-cycle of a building and, also, the ‘end of life’ stage, such as demolition and disassembly. Embodied carbon emissions account for 40% of global carbon emissions related to buildings.",

In order to maximise the benefits of this north-south site, a fully glazed curtain walling maximises internal daylight and views out to the canal to the north, while on the south façade deep-set, ribbon windows minimise solar gain. Full height windows and doors on both facades can be opened to allow for natural though ventilation. It is expected that the building can operate comfortably using natural ventilation for cooling."

Specialist acousticians developed acoustic guidelines for the office to ensure that there were a range of spaces where productivity would not be impacted by bustle and noise; the timber surfaces and panels within the building absorb sound and so improve comfort. Other areas within the building have been created for noisier and more collaborative work, such as the lounge and the café.",
