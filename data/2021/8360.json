                "PEER’s core ethos is to embed its activities into the local community and to offer and promote the highest quality art as being part of daily life. We have done this through our ambitious programme of projects working with nearly 150 artists, writers, curators and educators over two decades. It is equally our ambition to nurture and provide a platform for the talent of a diverse range of emerging, mid-career and established artists enabling them to take new risks. Past and recent examples include important commissions with Mike Nelson, Bob & Roberta Smith, Siobhan Hapaska, Fiona Banner, Emma Hart, Jimmy Robert and Catherine Story, to name but a few.",
                "PEER’s big aspirations and modest size play key roles in securing our place within the broader London art ecology. We offer both emerging and established artists the opportunity to test bold ideas in an intimate environment that stimulates experimentation and dialogue. Our human scale makes us less bureaucratic and opaque in comparison with many larger institutions. Artists cherish the opportunities that PEER has to offer, and the position that we occupy within the art world."

The project was phased due to deadlines attached to the various funding sources that the gallery secured, including the Arts Council and London Mayor’s Pocket Park fund, as well as crowdfunding and auctions organised by PEER.",
                "What was an inhospitable part of Hoxton Street has been transformed to an open and welcoming public place with trees, paving, a raised bed of planting, seating, bike parking and public art commissions. PEER’s adjacent gallery façade has been renovated with floor to ceiling windows making exhibitions more visible from the street and integrating the organisation further into the local environment.",
                "A four-metre high freestanding pedestal clock has been installed on Hoxton Street and PEER’s first annual clock commission is Black Hands by Chris Ofili. Local groups have planted and cared for the planter bed."
