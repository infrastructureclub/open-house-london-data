This new pavilion provides a grand sense of arrival to the Hall which was missing from the previous entrance. The new glazed roof offers exciting new views of existing features, such as the distinctive cantilevered upper levels and ceremonial staircase. On floors 1-4, the floorplates have been extended, expanding the commercial letting space by 50%. Services have been replaced throughout, achieving a BREEAM “Exellent” rating."

The Salters’ later Halls were also destroyed by fires in 1598 and 1666, and during bombing raids in 1941.",

Its buildings are often characterised by the use of raw unfinished materials, bold geometries and the expression of function. Concrete proved an inexpensive material during the re-building of much of Britain after 1945. The term ‘Brutalist’ is derived from the French term “Beton Brut” meaning exposed concrete."
