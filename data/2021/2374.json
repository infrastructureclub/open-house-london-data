                "The museum is owned and operated by the Enfield and District Veteran Vehicle Trust, a registered charity. The building is an 1898 pumping station that was purchased by the Trust in 1986 in a near derelict state. It originally housed two steam engines and boilers which pumped water from the well below the building into the New River. Altogether some 16 pumping stations were built during the 19th century by the then New River Water Company and it is thought that Whitewebbs was one of the last.  The well, excavated in 1895, is 200ft deep and 14ft diameter at the surface reducing to 11ft at the bottom.  Supervised viewing of the well can be made when visiting.  It now houses historic cars, motorcyle & related memorabilia, WW1 & WW2 artefacts and a large collection dedicated to social history."
