                "During construction, a number of existing households were decanted and now have new homes, remaining together in the development. There are many family homes, including some five-bedroom homes for social rent.",

                "Most of the development is four to five storeys, consistent with the scale of the surrounding area. The scale increases at the two prominent mews street corners, where each block is crowned with a rooftop pavilion set back from the main façade. The highest nine-storey block provides a distinctive feature to hold the corner of the site and help mediate between the scale of the new block and the existing tower.",
                "The qualities of Peabody’s existing nineteenth century housing estates, along with the terrace house typology, are the reference points for the choice of materials and details. Two tones of brick are used. A rich buff brick predominates, and lighter creamy/white “gault” brick is used where the blocks are set back at higher levels. All residential units are dual aspect with optimal levels of daylight. Large external balconies are either recessed on the street frontages or project over the communal garden within. Private terraces for the ground floor family units provide a buffer between the private residences and the shared garden."

Community benefits include a new facility facing onto Freston Road. It accommodates a Social Enterprise Hub for young entrepreneurs to develop their businesses."
