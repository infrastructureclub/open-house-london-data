It is recorded that the Hall was opened with a concert where Sir Arthur Sullivan of Gilbert & Sullivan fame appeared as accompanist. It was the scene of grand banquets, concerts and important public meetings.  \nIt was used as an Army Recruitment office in 1914 and in the video you will see a photo of the Advance Guard assembling before they departed for Dover on the way to the trenches of the 1st World War. \nIt was later acquired by the GPO as a sorting office and in its present use as a pub its simple, open interior is well preserved."

It became Bromley’s first department store.  It was also a bakery and sold not just food but also clothes, footwear and was a drapers.  \nThe Co-Op was not welcome initially in Bromley but it remained as a successful store until 1933 when an even bigger department store was built for the Coop in Widmore Road. \nAt the back of the shop in East Street was the working side: stables, storage and in particular ovens for the large scale manufacture of bread. This part of the building was made into a theatre in 1938 after the Co-op had vacated the building.  Bromley Little Theatre still operates here with a 110 seat auditorium, bar and rehearsal rooms.  The video shows exterior and interior views of the stage and bar area."

The video highlights the local materials used with features like decorative glazed terracotta tilework and shells on the exterior.   The building is listed in the directory in 1879 as the 'Railway Hotel – Temperance' reflecting concern amongst the ruling classes about drunkenness and unruly behaviour among the workers.  The video shows how the brewer's name is built in to the brickwork so it was never intended to be a temperance hotel for long! Victorian society was stratified into classes and this reflected in the labyrinth of rooms and separate entrances for people of different classes."

It is Grade II Listed. See the projecting upper storeys and turret, especially the finely carved wooden medallion and mosaic on the threshold – all things that Arts & Crafts architects liked to do to liven up their buildings and make them - in this case - like an old country inn. \nFireplaces and other details inside have been preserved."

Built by another local butcher who grew rich, Amos Borer. The style is thought to be a tribute to the Emperor Napoleon III and Empress Eugenie living in exile at Camden Place Chislehurst for whom Mr Borer was ‘Purveyor of Meat’.\nAnother indication of Bromley’s growing importance in this late Victorian period."
