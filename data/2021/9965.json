The interior is unremarkable, but the extravagant, redbrick and bath stone Edwardian Baroque façade consists of a large gable pierced by an ornamented, oriel window with projecting two-storey bays on either side. The one on the left includes sculptures of an atalante and a catyrid (to which, in an inspired move, someone has added red paint in the manner of lipstick). Handsome, stone mullioned windows with art nouveau glasswork throughout the original structure. A side wing to the left has an extra storey added in the 1930's."

                "The Passmore Edwards Library at Acton was opened in 1900 by the American Ambassador Joseph Choate. Named after John Passmore Edwards who paid £4,000 of the £6,690 building costs. Choate, like Passmore Edwards supported the temperance movement, An attractive free public lending library with some 8,000 volumes of wholesome literature was created, in part, as an alternative for the poor to the vice (as they saw it) of alcohol to be found in the many brightly lit pubs Acton then supported. During its working life, the large number of industrial premises in the area meant the library had a technical section, which in the 1950's and 1960's had the reputation of being the best in West London. Together with the [now former] Town Hall, the swimming baths and [also former] Magistrates’ Court, this group of buildings gave Acton a civic centre. Even today, people remember the library with affection, with the Children’s’ library a particularly popular facility. Despite its iconic appearance, its status as an Asset of Community Value, its history and its central location, it has not been of any benefit to the community since it closed in 2014 - until now…"

                "The building is occupied by an educational training company on the upper two floors and will be (eventually) by a two-screen cinema on the ground floor.  Planning permission has been agreed for the capital work necessary to re-purpose the ground floor - which will include an acoustic box for soundproofing. Until further investment is available, the immediate plan is to construct a single screen pop-up cinema with a simple bar/café, as a ‘meanwhile’ solution. The seating in the Pop-up will be placed on a series of rostrums to achieve the rake and will be organised to meet any current COVID recommendations. The Pop-up cinema is intended to last for 18 – 24 months and to act as a stepping stone in the development of our project – allowing us to communicate and engage with our community and supporters. We will use the programming facilities and marketing skills of the Rio Cinema team to establish an audience for our setting and begin to establish revenue streams and, hopefully, attract investment for the implementing of the full plans.\nDuring this initial stage of the project the ground floor will also be home to a Gallery for art displays.  Our cafe/bar is situated in the corner of the building where the natural light is optimal and customers have easy access to either the cinema or the Gallery."
