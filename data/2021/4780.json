                "A semi detached late Victorian house on a wide street in a leafy neighbourhood, where the existing house lacked natural light and suffered from a very gloomy and highly compartmentalised plan – but with great potential. The interior was stripped out, the back extension demolished, the house gutted, half of the original stair retained and the other half newly designed to reflect the addition to the loft extension, adding more space than was ever imagined possible.",
                "The house is in a typical street of this area of Wandsworth and Putney. From the front the only signs of difference are the luminous downpours of light one sees through the windows that can only suggest the vast openings at the back."

                "Following the near-gutting of the interior of the house, a continuation of the original stair now rises two-storeys in structural glass, inserted between a new large skylight prism and a two-way mirror, which reflects the lush garden behind. On the other side of the two-way mirror is the shower that not only offers uninterrupted views of the garden, but also gives the user the confidence of full privacy. This memorable skylight allows daylight to flood down through the entire house. The nearly open plan ground level permits the space to flow through the double reception room and the light to bounce freely throughout into the kitchen.",
                "The rebuilt back extension seems to be hovering over the kitchen space that explodes the limits of the outside. Two glassed envelopes push the confines of the hard swathe. On the north facing side extension a sloping glassed roof frames an existing Victorian door, enhancing the quality of this feature. At the far end, and echoing the glass prism on the top of the stairwell, a vast opening extrudes into the garden. Materials carry on from the inside out giving continuum to the space and incorporating the outside in. The shadowy orientation of the house protects the glazing from thermal gains.",
                "At loft level a grand master bedroom suite with a balcony frames the view of the back elevation of the opposite row of houses that at dawn reflect the most wonderful expression of the first red rays of the sun. This dormer clad in a warm fabric of thin larch slats replicates the abstract language of pure volumes in the house. And above, the sun deck overlooks the church tower on Santos Road and its surroundings."
