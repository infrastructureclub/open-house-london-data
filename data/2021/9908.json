Another building by the same architect can be seen on a grander scale opposite the library in the form of the Old Town Hall.",
                "The library received commission through an endowment from Sir William James Mallinson. Legend has it that the timber in the Mallinson room came through the philanthropist's own forestry companies based in Canada. If you look closely, you can see a subtle Egyptian motif etched into the book cases. Egyptian aesthetics were an integral part of the language of Art Decco decorations, owing in-part to the discoveries of ancient tombs within the Valley of Kings that capture the imagination of Western popular culture!"
