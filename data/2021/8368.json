                "The scheme was driven by the strong immediate context including several listed buildings which impacted on the density that could be achieved on the site. Varying building heights due to differing conditions on each street façade and to the rear meant a staggered building form was required.",
                "The retail units facing Walworth Road needed to be carefully designed to avoid impacting the long façade along Walworth Road and dividing the space with columns. These retail space were designed flexibly to allow the space to be taken by one large operator or several smaller companies",
                "We designed the servicing to be from Amelia Street to keep off the red route of Walworth Road including bus stops directly in front of the site.",
                "We introduced of a number of cores and a few short elements of deck access to maximise the number of dual aspect flats, providing good daylight and ventilation to the sales flats."

                "There are two key components of this scheme, first its relationship with the streets in re-interpreting a historical massing and rhythm to both streets. This was achieved by breaking down the elevations with different brick types and consistent window patterns whilst being flexible with the plan type behind the façade. This allowed the contemporary and modern design to fit comfortably around the existing public house.",
                "The second important feature is the courtyard, it provides a central hub which two cores are directly accessed ensuring that there is activity within the communal amenity space. The landscaped design not only acts as peaceful oasis from the busy Walworth Road but an attractive outlook for the majority of flats.",

                "The cores were separated by tenure for management issues but the scheme is tenure blind as a whole."
