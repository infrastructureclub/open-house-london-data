The name Feltham is Feldham meaning a village in a field or on an open plain.  Another derivation is from Felte (meaning soft or woolly leaved), which is the Old English plant name for Mullein - genus Verbascum.  Later spelling of the place-name were Feltesham in 1274, Felten in 1668 and finally by 1800 Feltham."
