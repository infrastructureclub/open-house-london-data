                "The Royal Courts of Justice are a Gothic revival gem.  ​The nearby Inns of Court are tranquil oases tucked beside the River Thames between the City of London and the City of Westminster.  They lie at the very heart of the English Legal System, but few Londoners other than lawyers ever visit and even most lawyers do not know their history.  They contain some of London’s most beautiful late seventeenth and eighteenth century vernacular architecture, one of London’s oldest churches, and are full of stories.  Get away from the crowds and explore this beautiful corner of historic London!"
