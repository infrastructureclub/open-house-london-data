                "This journey of less than a mile along the South Bank between Westminster and Waterloo Bridges will consider the surviving vestiges of London’s Festival of Britain in its 70th anniversary. The tour will consider the shifting political plans for the festival that began in the mid 1930s and celebrate the planners, designers and architects employed by the then London County Council behind its success. We will explore not only the major buildings that dominate this short reach of riverbank (County Hall, and the Three Graces of the South Bank: The Royal Festival Hall, The Hayward Gallery and the National Theatre) but also find the few remnants of the year-long, postwar celebration of British Modernism that have survived. The journey will look at the history of the South Bank and contrast its industrial and entertainment traditions with Westminster’s power and politics and consider the role played by the London County Council and later the GLC in challenging these dynamics.\n \nRoute notes: There are steps to the South Bank walkways around the Hayward Gallery and National Theatre and a lift is available nearby",
