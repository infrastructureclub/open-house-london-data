                "It was designed originally as two buildings behind a common façade, the Union Club to the south, and the Royal College of Physicians to the north.",
                "In 1923, Canadian High Commissioner, the Honourable Peter Larkin, led the purchase of the Union Club on behalf of the Canadian government. The plan was to secure diplomatic premises in the heart of an area known at the time as 'Little Canada'. Architect Septimus Warwick was engaged to refurbish the building, which involved major remodelling of the interior and reconstruction of the south façade. King George V officially opened Canada House in June 1925.",
                "During World War II, Canada House became fondly known as a home away from home for Canadians serving in the Allied Forces.",
                "In 1964 the High Commission acquired the lease to the Royal College of Physicians. In the process of incorporating two buildings into one, a number of features were covered up or removed. Many of these aspects were rediscovered during more recent refurbishment work."

                "The exhibition by Saskatchewan-based artist, Zachari Logan, features key elements of his practice. Logan has always seen nature and the body as both inextricably linked and interchangeable. The forms of flowers and foliage in his exquisite drawings can ‘stand in’ for the human body and for human emotions. In some of his works metamorphosis takes place, and the body changes into nature, and vice versa. However we are not talking about flower arrangements in a vase of carefully cultivated blooms. Join us on 11th September to discover more. Due to COVID restrictions, only the Canada Gallery will be accessible to the public for this year’s Open House; however, a brand new virtual tour of Canada House will be available to view when visiting the Canada Gallery. Launched for the 96th birthday of Canada House on 29th June 2021, the virtual tour includes content not usually seen on our public tours."
