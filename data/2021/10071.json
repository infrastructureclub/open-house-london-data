Until the mid-19th century, the village comprised little more than a few shops and inns and some imposing houses, mainly around the Green and Common. It grew rapidly after the building of Hammersmith Bridge and the railway, but even today, Barnes, while part of one of the world's busiest cities, still offers a real taste of village life.",
                "The boundaries of Barnes have been undisputed for centuries and the village occupies 902 acres. This walk will take you to its western extremity where it borders Mortlake village. Mortlake was also listed in the Domesday book under its Saxon name Mortelage (possibly meaning a watercourse controlled by Morta, a Saxon leader). Although they didn't always see eye to eye, both villages benefited from being able to trade with the ever growing city of London down river."

The Barnes Community Association launched a Pond Appeal for £200,000 and this, together with a Council grant of £60,000 and advice from the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, enabled experts to be employed to reline and restore the pond, which was refilled in April 2003. During the final stages of the work the cause of the mystery was discovered: a six-inch outlet pipe had somehow become unplugged, causing the water to drain away so rapidly, although what caused the plug to come out is still a mystery. The pipe now forms the emergency overflow.",
                "In the middle of the Green is the former village school which has pretty bargeboards. It was founded in 1775 and was the size of a small cottage but as the demand for education increased it was added to substantially. Elm Cottage was built for the village schoolmaster. Bowls was played on the village green at the site of the school in Tudor times but when the school was built on the site, this ancient club was moved to the rear of the Sun Inn, where its Green has been in constant use ever since.",
                "The pond (first mentioned in a manorial survey of 1649 but most probably older than the village itself) reminds us that Barnes is on a flood plain and within a meander loop with much surface water. Indeed there were also a series of small ponds and streams on the Green until the 19th century."

The road runs into Beverley Path; this is an ancient route crossing land known as the Goslings (recorded in 1464 as Geseland, where geese were reared).\nThis area was damp and also suitable for growing licorice. There used to be a tiny pub here, called The Idle Hour and known in the past as The Manor Arms but it has since been developed into residential property.",

Peter Scott, the naturalist, successfully fought to prevent urban sprawl here and created this home for rare waterbirds. On the other side lies Barn Elms, once the site of the medieval manor house.

Despite that, it survived IRA bombs in 1938 and again in 200 though is currently closed to pedestrian and vehicular traffic owing to safety concerns.",

Major Boileau gave land for the building of Trinity Church in 1868 and The Boileau Arms was built in 1894, but has changed its name since. Opposite is the former Bridge Hotel (built 1904) with an original gas lamp hanging over the door.",

Now it has become a key landmark along the University Boat Race course.\nThe building of the Harrods Village Estate helped in part to fund the creation of the Wetlands wildlife preservation in Barnes."
