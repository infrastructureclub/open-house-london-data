Our built environment is evidence of an ongoing process of change and renewal. Much of this is not wholesale demolition and new build, but the updating and adaptation of what is there already. For example former warehouses have become residential flats and we have a major art gallery in what was once a power station.\nThe tour considers what different scenarios lie behind this process of change and the design creativity that can emerge as a result.",
