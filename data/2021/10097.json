                "The site of Maryland House had difficulty obtaining planning permission since 2002, but in 2016 Remi Connolly-Taylor and the Studio took on the challenge as a development scheme. When Remi returned from her period in New York City, she noticed the housing market didn’t reflect her needs as a young business owner. She wanted a space that allowed for ample natural light and room to work in a flexible studio. The proposal provides a bold bookend to the terraced street. By utilising London stocks related to surrounding dwellings, the Studio maintained the language and form of the area without compromising the quality of light to the adjacent structures.",
