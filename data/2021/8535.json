The project physically and emotionally supports those who live there by providing secure spaces to socialize, and public amenities to provide connections to the wider community."

Set within this complex context, the project reflects upon the heritage and contrasts of scale to create a project with a strong form and identity but also the intimacy of the human scale."

This sequence of blocks, (ranging from four storeys at its lowest point, to ten storeys at its highest), is finished in a brick skin which modulates in tone and texture as the blocks increase in height, as well as mediating between the varying mass and topography of the surrounding cityscape. \n      By looking at the variety of building forms, styles and materials which make up the conservation areas surrounding the site, we have created a scheme which subtly reflects this rich context.\n      The vast majority of homes have a dual aspect with views across the neighbourhood, and the city beyond."

Simple filigree metalwork is used for the balustrades and, at every level, a thin band of precast concrete unifies the composition and complements the horizontality of adjacent properties."
