The porch and octagonal hall were added in 1859 by Mayhew and Knight and the interiors modified by Mewes and Davis before 1914.",
                "Because of its position between Halkin Street and Grosvenor Crescent, the building was known for many years as ‘The Independent North Mansion’ though named as ‘Belgrave Villa’ by Sidney Herbert and as ‘The Villa’ by his successor in 1861, the 6th Duke of Richmond. After the 7th Duke died in 1928 the house was acquired by the gold and diamond magnate Sir Otto Beit and sold by his son Sir Alfred in 1936, when it became the residence of the Argentine Ambassador.",
                "The historic mansion was acquired in 1936 by Argentina with its furniture and paintings. Beautiful and precious objects, lamps, works of art, tapestries, mirrors, all give character, grandiosity, and an allure of a time gone by."

In addition -  the reception organized in 1990 for the restitution of diplomatic relations between Buenos Aires and London; the official visits of three Argentine presidents; and two contemporary art exhibitions ‘Casa Abierta – Open House’ which took place during Open House London 2006 and 2010.",
