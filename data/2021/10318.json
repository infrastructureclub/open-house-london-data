                "With a diminutive size of only 31sq m, the new studio for architectural photojournalist Gareth Gardner makes ingenious use of space, acting as a workspace as well as a gallery hosting a programme of photographic exhibitions.​ ​",
                "Architectural practice Studio C102’s brief was to refurbish an existing creative workspace unit, part of the Enclave Studios development in Deptford, South-East London. The solution needed to be inherently practical and robust, able to deal with the rigours of public access to the gallery space while providing ample and secure storage of photographic equipment, archive and library.​\n​\nStudio C102’s design was inspired by art storage warehouses. A simple palette of rugged materials was used to construct the interior, including Kee-Klamp scaffolding, galvanized steel mesh panels and Valchromat solid surfaces. ​\n​\nThe public gallery space is divided from the back-of-house studio workspace by a full-height mesh screen. This allows daylight to penetrate deep into the workspace, while also providing a hanging surface for artworks. A reflective high-gloss epoxy floor further maximises the sense of space and light. The scaffold superstructure doubles-up as support rig for the gallery spotlights.​\n​\nA similar 3.5m tall reconfigurable screen was also constructed in the ‘shopfront’ window, providing a street-facing hanging surface, which can be removed for the display of three-dimensional objects.​\n​\nThe warehouse typology has been playfully subverted through the introduction of splashes of pink and yellow, deployed on the floor-to-ceiling shelving, bespoke lighting elements, furniture and stockroom steps. However, it was vital that the overall space retained the neutral colour balance needed for the accurate viewing of photographs.​\n​\nA demountable table with removable yellow TIPTOE legs and stackable pink Canteen chairs from Very Good & Proper allow the gallery space to be reconfigured for meetings and print preparation. A vintage floor-standing photographic enlarger has been repurposed as a digital display."
