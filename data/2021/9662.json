                "“This beautiful new centre will enhance people’s wellbeing across Sands End and south Fulham, it has been set up to ensure that it is truly for people of all backgrounds, and that residents are in the driving seat for this new community space in Hammersmith and Fulham.” - Cllr Andrew Jones, Hammersmith and Fulham Cabinet Member for the Economy and the Arts",

We're proud to have provided smart but unobstrusive MEP solutions that enable visitors to enjoy a beautiful, naturally ventilated building fuelled by green energy that can accommodate a broad range of community events.\" - Lidia Guerra, Engineer and Partner at Max Fordham"

                "The building uses an innovative brick made from waste by specialist supplier StoneCycling. This is the first time the bricks have been used in the UK and means that the project effectively upcycles over 28 tonnes of potential construction landfill material. The bespoke ‘Nougat’ WasteBasedBricks® have been created specifically for Sands End, to suit the context and its characteristics.",
                "Focusing on flexibility and making sure each space can adapt to a dynamic programme of functions, simple and unobtrusive MEP services appropriate to their setting were implemented. Enhancing usability and maintainability, they simultaneously keep down cost due to high energy efficiency. The fabric and glazing strategy carefully balance winter passive solar gain with summer comfort, without resorting to complex cooling or shading devices.",
                "To that end, the main spaces within the building are naturally ventilated, providing free cooling without air-conditioning plant."

With this in mind, we’ve created lines of LED fittings, simple in colour and shape, and varied mountings and brightness to achieve uniformity with the steep sloped ceilings. A full LED system with daylight dimming throughout matches the energy efficiency aspirations of the whole project.\" - David Atkinson, Senior Engineer at Max Fordham",

                "The timber roof construction gives a natural lightness to the space which is lit by large north facing clerestory. Internally the exposed timber structure reinforces the sustainable agenda behind the project while giving a highly tactile quality to the space."
