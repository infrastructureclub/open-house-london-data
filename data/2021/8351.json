Aldgate Square is now one of the largest public spaces in the City of London and is home to the new Portsoken Pavilion.",
                "The Pavilion, designed by Make Architects, provides a space for events, leisure and natural surveillance for the community. The social enterprise café, Kahaila, within the Pavilion also provides accessible toilets which are always available to the public seven days a week through the City’s Community Toilet Scheme.",
                "Extensive regeneration and landscaping was also carried out in the listed churchyard to create a tranquil gated space immediately surrounding the Church. The Church’s railing has been restored along with the original colour. In addition, it was discovered that the gates at the front of the Church once held lanterns, which have been replicated from records at the London Metropolitan Archives.",
