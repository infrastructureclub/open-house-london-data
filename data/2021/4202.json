                "A new build, low energy, house on a narrow site in Bayswater designed to minimise its carbon footprint. The building is a comfortable family house yet it’s also an example of how sustainable architecture can be achieved without compromise on the tightest of sites.",
                "The building has a highly-insulated building envelope and utilises passively ventilated bathrooms to reduce energy consumption. A ground-coupled heat pump system maximises winter solar gain and minimises summer cooling by drawing heat out of the ground in winter, using three 50m deep bore holes - these connect back to a heat pump that extracts the heat and transfers it to the underfloor heating circuits that run throughout the house. Rainwater is harvested to flush the toilets.",
                "The stair running up the centre of the house is made from a sustainably sourced 19mm larch composite board. It has a central void to allow light down from the roof light to each of the floors into the centre of the plan. It’s also held off the walls with stainless steel pins and thus allows more light down around the edges and architecturally separates the stair from the walls, making it feel more like a piece of sculpture than a stair."
