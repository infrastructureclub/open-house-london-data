The designs were inspired by period homes that have characterful features that form a backdrop to people's lives.  Using a brick motif, the entrance ways to communal areas feature black and white herringbone tiling that references the thresholds found in Victorian and Georgian homes.",
                "Moving into the more private spaces the language and proportions are continued, but the colours and tones become more subdued. In the apartments there is parquet oak flooring and soft grey tiles in a herringbone format. We have deliberately paired standard internal products with good quality materials where you can touch them, for example the handles to the kitchen units and a good quality work top."
