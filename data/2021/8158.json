Constellations are etched into the faces of the timber and the form of the portals helps re-define the double-height teaching space and provide a cathedral-like scale to a small rediscovered part of the school."

Floor projection IT equipment allows for pupils to feature inside the presentation: a form of interactive and inclusive learning.
