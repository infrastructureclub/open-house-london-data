                "17 Bloomsbury Square is a “house with a history” in more than one sense. Not only does the house itself have a long and turbulent history, but nowadays it houses The German Historical Institute London (GHIL) – an esteemed historical institute.",
                "Bloomsbury Square was originally called Southampton Square after its founder Thomas Wriothesley (1607-1667), the fourth Earl of Southampton. It was landscaped in the 1660s and is one of London’s earliest squares. It was considered one of the most desirable residential areas in the city."

                "No. 17 stands at the northwest corner of the square, extending to another entrance at 72/73 Russell Street. The area became prestigious and began to attract the nobility in the 18C.",
                "The house underwent its greatest changes under the ownership of John Rushout (1739-1800), the first Baron Northwick. In 1777 Rushout commissioned the architect John Nash (1752-1835) to reconstruct the building.",
                "In only 18 months Nash oversaw major renovations. Most notably he divided the building into two separate houses, added Corinthian-style columns and had the walls plastered, a novel technique at the time. As for the interior, Nash was responsible for the two magnificent staircases, glass cupolas and the elaborate ceilings on the first floor in the style of James and Robert Adam.",
                "Although splendidly refurbished, the corner building stood vacant for a time as London’s high society moved westwards. Bloomsbury Square lost its appeal for aristocrats and became an increasingly middle-class residential area. The middle classes were then supplanted by firms, associations and institutions in the mid-19th century – and No. 17 was no exception.",
                "In 1841 the building was leased to the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, whose name is still engraved in large letters on the front of the property. Several alterations to the building were made as the Society grew with the addition of a further storey and a porch.",
                "For over a century, 17 Bloomsbury Square served as the centre of the pharmaceutical profession in Britain. In 1976 the government placed a compulsory purchase order on No. 17 (amongst other houses) in an attempt to build the new British Library, a move staunchly opposed by the Bloomsbury Association. As a result the buildings were to be resold at auction and the corner building was home to squatters for four years in the interim.",
                "In April 1980, the ownership rights to the house passed to the Volkswagen Foundation which leased it to the German Historical Institute. After years of neglect the building was in dire need of refurbishment and the Volkswagen Foundation took great care to recreate the character of the house. You may note that the crystal chandeliers on the first floor are exact replicas of the originals."

                "Over the years the prestige of the GHIL has grown steadily and today it holds a respected position among London’s research institutions. It is home to various research projects on British, German and Anglo-German history; hosts conferences, lectures and exhibitions; and houses an extensive library on German history and Anglo-German relations from the Middle Ages to the present.",
