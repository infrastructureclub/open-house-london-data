It is part of a wider collection of tour events created by Golden Key Academy guides for Open House Festival celebrating their conclusion of the sixth month course. \nThis tour will be conducted using live audio and image sharing from your guide via Zoom who will be with you in person for the duration of the tour. The use of Zoom is to enable you to keep safe, space out and still be able to hear the tour.\n \nAttendees must download Zoom before the tour, bring a fully charged smart phone with internet connection, and headphones; and remember to stay at least two metres apart from each other where required. Zoom joining info will be sent out to bookers a day or so before the tour. \n \nAll walking tours 20 max. Pre book only."
