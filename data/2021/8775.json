The masterplan proposals seek to improve the interface with the Welsh Harp by providing a new linear park on this edge and also to reconnect the currently isolated site to the surrounding streets and open spaces by placing a new park on the route up to Hendon train station."

                "The Green is a more formal urban park also creating a visual link from the Broadway to the Welsh Harp. The space evolves from a formal urban space (Broadway Place) at the entrance to the scheme to a more informal new York Park along the edge of the Welsh Harp.",
                "The new York Park is a linear Park stretching from the south all along the eastern edge of the Welsh Harp and is 20m wide at its narrow points but widens amongst new buildings. This park also includes and incorporates the protected Memorial trees and a wide range of lay spaces."
