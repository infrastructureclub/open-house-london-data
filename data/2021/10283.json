The fund is being delivered by Historic England and will unlock the potential of high streets, fueling economic, social and cultural recovery and breathe new life into town centers for future generations. This will be a chance to learn a little more about the heritage program that will support this project, share your stories and explore the area using one of our free self-guided walking tours that will take you around this fascinating town. In addition our NLHF project, Meet the Collection, will showcase items from the borough's fascinating and unique museum and archive collection."
