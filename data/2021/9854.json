The lower level is similarly open-plan, but concealed doors enable it to be divided into a yoga space, bedroom, and bathroom.",

The staircases, closed-riser to one flight and open-riser to the other, are similarly treated as planes of timber—folded, and divided and arrayed respectively, referencing the processes of drawing. The other volumes and planes of the architectural composition are variously finished in cement, terrazzo, murals, and a white paint finish. Flood lamps, ubiquitous on building sites, recall the process of construction."

                "WILLIAM TOZER Associates is an award-winning practice headquartered in London, England. The practice has broad experience, including in housing, office, retail, and hospitality sectors, and has worked on projects in the UK, US, Australia and New Zealand. Their work is particularly indebted to the practice of early-twentieth century Viennese modernist master architect Adolf Loos, on whom practice founder William Tozer completed his doctorate at the Bartlett.\n \nWILLIAM TOZER Associates understands architecture as compositions of abstract sculptural form and space, and discrete functional 'furnishings' at various scales. Each project curates and re-frames the context and history of its site, and captures the open-endedness of the processes of demolition and construction. Their projects make sculptural compositions of volumes and planes, loosely dividing open-plan spaces into zones of use through their alignments and misalignments, changes of floor and ceiling level, and continuities and distinctions in the selection of materials, lighting, and other fixtures and fittings. Experiencing their finished architectural projects gives users and viewers a sense of engagement with the processes of conception, demolition and construction that are usually erased—a form of ‘action architecture’, giving formal and spatial expression to contemporary craft processes, including writing and drawing."
