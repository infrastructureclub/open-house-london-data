                "Founded by Trevor Morriss in 2007, we have an exciting portfolio of completed and live projects across a multiple of sectors in the UK and around the world.",
                "Our success in securing high value planning approvals in sensitive locations is well recognised.  We are proud of our reputation and the talented individuals that collectively and consistently deliver for our clients and our collaborators through a thorough understanding of creative, sustainable design and executed detail inspired by our continual pursuit of excellence.",
                "Following 7 years at JLL, Trevor Morriss has an unparalleled insight into the development process, passionate about architecture, he recognised the lack of design led practices that wholly understand the commercial drivers of a scheme and so conceived SPPARC in response.",
                "We are told our clients choose us for our high-quality architecture which is grounded with commercial sensitivity and a deliverable reality.  The contractor fraternity like us for our proven thoughtful attention to meticulous practical details.  These are rare and powerful combinations.",
                "From the outset of the design process, SPPARC enhance the opportunities for design by releasing each projects potential to its fullest and creating higher value unlocked by our curiosity to push the boundaries of the brief.",
                "We are selective in the projects that we undertake to ensure that we provide the exemplar service our clients expect.  All SPPARC’s projects are informed by the way people interact and reflect the importance of the architecture and interior fabric that surrounds them to be socially relevant in our changing world.",
                "We enjoy working across varying scales to create buildings, masterplans, interiors, landscaped places and object design.  Project values range from £250,000 to £500 million encompassing all stages of the RIBA work plan.",
                "We consider it a great privilege to be in an industry where the outcome effects the environment that we live in.  The work that we create is taken very seriously but with an essential blend of humour.  Sustainability is vital to our design process, ensuring that we have a positive influence on the world around us.",
                "The strong ethos of SPPARC is that creativity should live and breathe in an environment where everyone is encouraged, respected and supported – hence a wonderful SPPARC family has been born! Ideas are shared, and skills are developed in a space where the learning never stops – no matter the level of experience.",
                "There is an excited energy and buzz to the studio and workshop which is nurtured on a daily basis to uphold the unique quality of SPPARC."
