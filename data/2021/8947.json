Poplar Works was conceived around the idea that fashion could again become a major part of East London’s social and economic make-up. The project 'seeds' creative industries in anticipation of the Poplar Riverside Housing Zone, providing ‘. . . a blueprint for future approaches to workspace in the local and surrounding areas’."

A large sewer under the length of this site limited new ground works. The building plan follows the linear footprint of the existing garages, which are refurbished to provide ground floor units. New upper floors and roofs are constructed in cross laminated timber (CLT) The cranked plan results in a roadside building 170m in length by 5.5m wide, unfolding in a dynamic zigzag, alongside the Blackwall Tunnel approach."

The elevation to Abbott Road, on the other hand, becomes an active street frontage of business and creative industry; coloured timber boarding and graphics providing animation, warmth and legibility. \nAt the north end of the site the building height is increased to present a tall elevation and entrance building, accommodating a café and first floor gallery overlooking a 8m high interior. The CLT structure is left exposed throughout, providing a warm interior aesthetic, complementing natural light, whilst other ground floor accommodation is characterised by an industrial language of painted steel structure and existing block-work walls, with carefully composed surface-mounted conduits."
