Just a short walk from King’s Cross station, the pavilion sits beside the restored railway arches. Secondary functions such as the toilets and plant are positioned within the depth of the plan, presenting an active frontage to the adjacent public realm allowing greater activity along its peripheries, especially adjacent to the historic ramp."

Integrating with other retail and leisure amenities, the pavilion is surrounded by a mix of retail and hospitality and publicly accessible open space and is intended to improve the social, cultural and economic character of the local area."

The intricately detailed façade constructed from cast iron was designed in close-collaboration with the casting iron fabricators, and references the site’s industrial past. Adding an element of visual delight to the streetscape, the abstracted pattern is derived from the molecular arrangement of coal. The patterning is also applied to the lift shaft which helps to define an edge to the south-western corner of Granary Square."

Landscaping plans include six new London plane trees along Stable Street, which act as stepping-stone habitat and green link in a highly urbanised location.\nNet carbon emissions for the scheme have been estimated to be circa. 94.3 kgCO2/m2.yr"
