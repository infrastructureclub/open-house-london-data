The original masterplan and first new buildings are by Terry Farrell, with later buildings by Wilkinson Eyre and Sheppard Robson.\n \nDirections\nLeave Regent’s Place towards the south > when you get to Euston Road turn right > cross the road just before Great Portland Street underground station >  bear left down Cleveland Street The BT Tower is a few minutes’ walk down here, on the corner of Maple Street on the left – though you’ll need to look up to appreciate it!\nWalking time 7 minutes\n \nBT Tower, 45 Maple Street, London W1T 4BG\n \nAn enduring, distinctive feature of the London skyline with a famous revolving floor that was originally a restaurant operated by Butlin’s. 158m above the capital, it was the city’s tallest building until 1980. Grade II listed. Still an important communications hub. Design: GR Yeats, Eric Bedford, Ministry of Public Buildings & Works, 1965\n \nDirections\nWalk along Maple Street – it crosses Tottenham Court Road and becomes University Street > keep going to the end > turn right into Gower Street > take the next turn on the left (Torrington Place) > then first right into Malet Street. Senate House is on the left just before the end of the street.\nWalking time 13 minutes\n \nSenate House, Malet Street, London WC1E 7HU\nLondon’s tallest secular building when it opened as the HQ of the University of London and home to the Ministry of Information during WWII, this Grade II* listed landmark features elements of Classicism and Art Deco. Design: Charles Holden, 1933\n \nDirections\nLeave Senate House by the far side from where you arrived > carry on until you reach Russell Square. Head for the far left corner of the square (follow signposts to the underground station if unclear) > take the road along the side of the large hotel (the Kimpton Fitzroy, formerly the Russell) > continue past the station > the entrance to the Brunswick Centre is a little beyond, on the left.\nWalking time 8 minutes\n \nBrunswick Centre, London WC1N 1BS\nThe Brunswick Centre was designed by Patrick Hodgkinson in the mid-1960s, based on studies by Leslie Martin, in an unusual ‘Ziggurat’ style. It was initially planned as a private development at a time when private, mixed-use development in the UK was rare. Building started in 1967 and was completed in 1972, though the building fell some way short of its intended size. The original plan extended up to Euston Road but the Ministry of Defence would not release the site of a building they leased for use by the Territorial Army.\n \nNearest Station: Russell Square"
