                "Reliance Arcade is a long, straight and narrow arcade that runs east to west between Electric Lane and Brixton Road. It is the oldest part of a cluster of covered markets in Brixton which were constructed in the early 2oth Century when market traders were relocated from Brixton Road. The Arcade itself was built between 1925-1926 on the site of a large 19th Century house that occupied a long narrow strip of land. At present, the arcade is a busy pedestrian route connecting Brixton Road to Electric Lane and Market Row that houses 40 small units providing a range of retail outlets run by small business operators.",
                "The Brixton Market complex formed the commercial and social heart of the extensive Afro-Caribbean community that settled in Brixton after WWII. The successful adoption of the markets is the clearest architectural manifestation of the major wave of immigration that had such an important impact on the cultural and social landscape of post-war Britain, and is thus a site with considerable historical resonance.",
                "Brixton is widely recognised as the pre-eminent district of Afro-Caribbean settlement and culture in both the capital and the country. This identity emerged quickly from the 1950s when immigrants from the West Indies, in particular Jamaica, settled in this South London suburb, largely due to cheap housing opportunities. With hundreds, then thousands, of newly-arrived immigrants lodging in boarding houses, the new community settled with a considerable presence in the area.",
                "The Importance of the Brixton Markets was chronicled by The Oxford Companion to Black British History, which said:",
                "“Brixton Market, with its jumble of stalls selling plantains, Jamaican patties, yams, green bananas, and an array of Caribbean foodstuffs, rapidly became an important focal point for the new arrivals, many of whom made their homes in the adjacent environs of Atlantic Road, Electric Avenue, Coldharbour Lane, and Railton Road. By the late 1960s much of this area had become one of the largest and most important sites of Caribbean settlement in the United Kingdom, and word of Brixton’s reputation as ‘the spiritual home of Caribbeans in Britain’ spread ‘back home’, encouraging new generations of Caribbean settlers.”"
