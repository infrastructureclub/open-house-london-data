                "In the late 1860s, the East End was notoriously filthy and the poverty experienced by many in the area was unparalleled. The district was home to thousands of poor residents, many crammed into accommodation without any sanitation or proper ventilation.",
                "Seeking out the 'worst part of London', Archbishop Manning described Bow Road and the surrounding area as the 'hardest work he could find for the Dominican sisters and Roman Catholic nuns'.",
                "In 1868, Alfred House on Bow Road was converted into St Catherine’s Covent. One year later in 1869 the Catholic Church of Our Lady and St Catherine of Siena- Bow was built next door. In the convent the sisters ran both a free and paying school in which, “Course of instruction comprises all the ordinary subjects of English education, French, singing, drawing, typewriting and shorthand”.",
                "In 1923 the Dominican sisters left for Staffordshire. The church was taken over by the diocese and the convent was divided up and repurposed. The section of the convent that would become the Nunnery Gallery served as an industrial laundry, while other sections hosted a number of businesses including a furniture making workshop.",
                "In 1998 Bow Arts received a grant from Arts Council England that contributed to the founding of the Nunnery Gallery, housed in a section of the original convent. The Gallery is a unique building on the ground floor, surrounded by the Bow Arts studios.",
                "Presenting a diverse gallery programme, our exhibitions aim to appeal to a wide audience, with a particular focus on site-responsive work and art that explores the history and themes of the local area. Events accompany all our shows, including panels, workshops and film screenings, creating debate and discussion around art in the community."
