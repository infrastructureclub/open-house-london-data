                "Fulham Palace was for centuries one of the country residences of the Bishop of London, (Lord of the Manor of Fulham) and in the later twentieth century became his only home. The building is a mixture of styles and periods, but what survives is a Tudor manor house with Georgian additions and a Victorian chapel. The house was occupied by the Bishop until 1973, by which time he lived in a flat, the majority of rooms being used (and still are) as offices. Fulham Palace still belongs to the Church. Since April 2011 the site has been run by Fulham Palace Trust (Reg. Charity No. 1140088). The gardens contain fine specimen trees and were famous in the C17th due to the zeal of Bishop Compton who imported new species from all over the known world. Tree maps are available in the Museum.",
                "A restoration project (2010-12) included the Palace’s walled garden (C19th Vinery by Weeks of Chelsea rebuilt by Alitex in aluminium to its original design) and the adjoining Bishop’s Park. The Victorian stables were converted to the Jessie Mylne Education Centre (Thomas Ford Partnership). The work was funded by Hammersmith and Fulham Council with a grant of £3.5m from the National Lottery Heritage Fund. A section of the ancient moat (which enclosed the site until 1921) has been excavated either side of the bridge.  Note the new gates to the main entrance, copied from originals visible in photographs. The porter’s lodge (1821), was designed by the Reverend E. P Owen, an amateur architect. The pink colour was applied after scientific analysis. Both lodges have been modernised and are let for residential use. Phase three of our NLHF funded restoration project (total cost £3.8m) was completed in Spring 2019.  This project has opened up the north range to visitors, providing fascinating glimpses into the Palace's past with new galleries, exhibitions and interpretation within the original Tudor rooms."

The rest of the courtyard was added c.1500-20, including the tower which is comparable to that at the Old Palace, Hatfield. The porch was remodelled for Bishop Howley c.1815. The south façade was refaced in 1853 as indicated by the dated badge of Bishop Blomfield. The fountain is by William Butterfield (1886), as is the Coachman’s Lodge (1893) at the entrance.  The wooden gates to the courtyard have been dated by dendrochronology to 1493-5. The brickwork on the west façade was restored in 2018-19."

The windows of the north façade remain, as well as three altered rooms on the south.   Samuel Pepys Cockerell adapted the Palace from 1814-18 for Bishop Howley, removing the crenellations, adding an extra floor and remodelling the east front."
