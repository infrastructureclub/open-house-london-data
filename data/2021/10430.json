                "London was once the centre of a vast network of Inns built in cities, market towns and at strategic locations along the country's road network. Inns served as termini for stagecoach operators providing horse-drawn transport across the country, offering lodgings for visitors to the city, and rooms for political groups, informal courts and business. The George was one of a large number of these galleried Inns in London but today is the only survivor. Sitting amid the still-convivial courtyard in the shadow of its galleries today, we're in a mainly 17th century creation. The northern range is long gone, but the Inn is medieval in origin and was a going concern in 1388 when Chaucer's pilgrims set off for Canterbury from the Tabard Inn just next door."
