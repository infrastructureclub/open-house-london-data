                "Burton was a remarkable traveler and explorer, linguist, poet, soldier, diplomat, prolific author and translator of major works of Arab and other literature including: The Kama Sutra, 1,001 Arabian Nights and The Perfumed Garden. After an early career serving in the Army in India (1842-1853) and later fighting in the Crimean War (1855-1856), he travelled to Mecca as well as to Africa and the Americas under the auspices of the Royal Geographical Society. Between 1856-1860, he journeyed to the great lakes of central Africa in search of the source of the river Nile. Co-founder of the Anthropological Society of London in 1863 and Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, he was appointed a KCMG (Knights Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George) in 1886."

The stone door at the front of the tent was originally hinged but is now sealed shut.",
                "Within the tent the floor is paved in Carrara marble (Tuscany, Italy) with black marble inserts and the underside of the roof is painted to represent the heavens. At one end there is a marble altar and tabernacle, along with a number of the explorer’s possessions including dried flowers, lamps and camel bells."

Despite its significance, by 2007 the mausoleum was in very poor condition and was listed on English Heritage’s Buildings at Risk Register.",
