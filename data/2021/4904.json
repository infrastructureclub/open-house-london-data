Panning though the Ikea site and the link road, the tour will discuss development on Phase Two and Meanwhile usage at the Drumsheds.

A development partner is also being progressed for Meridian Two at Leeside Road, which will deliver 250 affordable homes. There will be 30,000 square feet of space on the ground floor aimed at housing creative industries. The transformation will represent a step-change away from industrial warehousing and logistics type uses, which are relatively plentiful in the Borough, offering higher skilled, higher paid employment opportunities for local people.",

On the tour you will be able to visit their brand new home, funded by the Council and the GLA, due to open later this summer.",
                "The Council also works with a number of operators to deliver temporary projects across the site, making efficient use of land, creating short to medium-term employment opportunities and bringing life and activity to the area early.  An example of this is the Drive-in Cinema on the East Bank of the river."
