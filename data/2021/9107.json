The new stadium, owned by the Football Association, was designed by Foster + Partners and Populus. It has a capacity of 90,000 and has its own iconic design statement with its 133m high arch, recognisably one of the features of 21st century London. Although the national football stadium, it is used for a variety of sporting and entertainment events and has state of the art facilities throughout. It has been used by Brent Council and Quintain, major landowners in the area, to act as a stimulus for major regeneration with new investment in commercial, retail, residential and public realm facilities.\n \nNearest Station: Wembley Park"
