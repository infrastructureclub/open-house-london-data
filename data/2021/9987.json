The Chapel is also the headquarters for the England London Mission with 160 full-time missionaries ages 19-24 in the London area from over 25 different countries.  The Chapel houses three congregations—two family oriented and one young single adult. This complex is also the centre for the London England Hyde Park Stake (similar to a diocese), comprising seven wards or congregations and over 2,000 members from over 50 countries."
