                "The church building both looks both backwards to Byzantine church architecture, with its barrel vault and saucer-shaped dome, and anticipates Modernist structures, with a tough, functional-looking aesthetic of plain stock brick and exposed concrete.",
                "This aesthetic, the pure proportion of the building, and its contrasts of dark and light have made the church popular with the critics, who regard it as prefiguring inter-war buildings like Battersea Power Station or the Underground Stations of Charles Holden. Critic Ian Nairn called it “the best church of its date in London”.",
                "Reilly came to design the church because he was a former pupil of the Merchant Taylors’ School, which established a mission on the site of the church in 1890. The church was preceded by a two-storey hall, built as part of this mission and used to provide education and support for local children and parents. Students from Merchant Taylors’ School spent time based at St Barnabas’, assisting the priest who served there."

The hall is now well-used, both by the church and by arts and community groups.",
