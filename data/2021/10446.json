                "Core Landscapes, a meanwhile based project in east London delivered by leading Mental Health Charity Core Arts, is a community garden space that teaches horticultural skills to promote positive wellbeing. The programme at Core Landscapes provides horticultural skills to those suffering from poor mental health, as well as a space for the wider community to engage with growing, and greening up public space around East London.",
                "In this film, horticulturist Nemone Mercer leads a tour of the rooftop garden, and explores how access to green space and access to green education is a tool to promote positive well being. Reflecting on the relationship between architecture and wellbeing through access to green space and green education, this project offers insight into improving wellbeing in our built environment, and the impact utilising underused spaces in our city can have.",
