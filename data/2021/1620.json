                "Severndroog Castle was built as a memorial to Sir William James by his widow, Lady James. William was best known for capturing Suvarnadurg in 1755, a port near Mumbi when employed by the East India Company. He became extremely wealthy and owned a large estate in Eltham, Park Farm Place and a fashionable town house in Gerrard Street, Soho. When he returned to London he became director of the East India Company, Fellow of the Royal Society and a member of parliament.",
                "Lady James also had personal wealth and built the fairy tale Severndroog Castle in 1784 in memory of her husband. A gothic style building, it is a folly, inspired by medieval architecture. She named it after her husband’s famous battle, using the English name Severndroog. It did not have any living accommodation and it is unclear how she used it, but research suggests she built it in this location so she could see it from her house in Eltham."
