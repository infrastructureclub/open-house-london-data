Despite Young’s closing in 2006, a small-scale brewery was maintained on site during the construction period to ensure that the development retained this legacy. Set within the Grade II* listed brewery complex is a new microbrewery, a heritage centre and accommodation for independent retailers, restaurants and exclusive loft-style apartments."

                "Ten lower-level buildings adopt and reinterpret the materials, forms and scale of the existing industrial structures to define the urban edges of the public realm. At ground level, the elevations are enlivened with retail units to create a vibrant and active environment, whilst above, the high-quality residential accommodation benefits from the more tranquil setting of private roof gardens."
