The first reference to a church is in 1312 and in 1333 a chapel dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary is recorded. Pictures show that this church was small, part stone, part timber with a small wooden tower.  By 1744 the building was dangerous. The local population had also grown significantly, attracted by the spa waters and the healthier and cleaner air above the City.  A new church was needed."

                "The church was consecrated on 8th October 1747 by the Bishop of Llandaff and was dedicated to St John, although no one thought to specify which one.  (In 1917 the Bishop of London decreed it to be the Evangelist.)"

                "In 1871 suggestions were made again for “beautifying and improving” the church.  The chosen architect F P Cockerell suggested demolishing the tower. A fierce conservation battle ensued resulting in a petition signed by 270 people including  William Holman Hunt, George du Maurier, Anthony Trollope, Edward Burne Jones, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Morris.  As a result the tower was not demolished.  Instead the entire church was realigned and the altar was moved to the west end, and a new and more elaborate chancel added."
