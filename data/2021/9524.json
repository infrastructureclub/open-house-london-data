                "Southwark Inclusive Learning Service Key Stage 3 (SILS 3) is a new school, a Pupil Referral Unit (PRU) in Peckham, south London. The School is run by the London Borough of Southwark.  The pupils at SILS 3 are there for a number of reasons, typically because they have been excluded from mainstream schools, have not been attending school or are at risk of exclusion. The aim of SILS 3 is to reintegrate these students back to mainstream school.",
                "The new building was built in the playground of the existing school which was previously a children’s home. The spaces and planning of the old building were ill suited to a PRU and it was demolished on completion of the new school.",
                "Our design intent for the new school was to make a calm, secure, robust educational environment that would improve the life chances of the children. The design was based on observation, consultation and research into the life of a PRU and the design factors that could benefit children and teachers.",
                "We wanted the building to feel cheerful and optimistic – the antithesis of the previous building. On the outside the building is made of near-white brick with big white window frames. Inside it has oak floors, maple joinery and pine ceilings.  It is light, spacious and calm and very robust without at all looking armoured or brutal, as such schools often do.\n \nThe building is highly sustainable with minimised energy use, by passive means where possible, and simple systems with simple operation and maintenance.",
                "Great attention has been paid to every aspect of design, from the layout to the smaller detail to ensure that the school works well."
