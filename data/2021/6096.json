The urban grain is drawn across the site, its dimensions related to natural light penetration, air movement and scale. The grain of narrow and wide bands structure the site and streetscape: narrow bands contain courtyards, service and cores, wide bands provide the teaching and learning spaces.",
                "The library is located to the north, establishing a connection to the main university campus in the Old Royal Naval College. Café, exhibition and retail spaces line Stockwell Street whilst at the corner, opposite Hawksmoor’s St Alfege Church, a slight setback creates a threshold, an entrance to the building and a pause in the street from which to turn with the church as its focus."

                "By providing specialist research environments, such as dedicated facilities for the study of algae and aquaponics, and sophisticated, bio-diverse learning spaces the roofs become an integral part of the academic conversation.",
                "Within, the studio space is designed as the heart of the academic building occupying the entire first floor. Seminar rooms overlook the studio forming part of its environment, creating an educational space of production and discussion.",
                "The building has the dual role of embedding itself as a piece of urban fabric to the south while making itself recognisable as a civic entity to the north. Its expression shifts in response to its context, appearing from Nevada Street as a series of tightly packed volumes which blend into the streetscape; as one rounds the corner this fabric begins begin to pull apart, revealing the activity within and establishing the university’s presence within the town as a space of academic excellence and urban connectivity."
