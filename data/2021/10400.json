                "In its heyday, Elephant & Castle was known as the ‘Piccadilly Circus of South London’, but for decades it has been synonymous with urban decay and failed planning. Despite its central\nlocation, this much ignored and unloved area has had a reputation for being an ugly, congested\npocket of south London, built around not just one but two busy roundabouts and with a network\nof dank, pedestrian subways, at the heart of which lay the famously outdated Elephant & Castle Shopping Centre. However, as this tour will show you, the ‘Elephant’ is in fact a fascinating, vibrant neighbourhood with a rich history and a promising future, boasting conservation areas, numerous listed buildings, pioneering post-war architecture and striking contemporary developments, all of which surround a new regeneration scheme which aims to bring the Elephant and its revitalized circus back to town.",

                "Guide: Despite moving away from London at a young age, Joseph Granata spent a lot of time visiting family and friends in the city and always felt a close affinity with his hometown. After studying architecture at the University of Manchester and working within the School of Continuity in Architecture, Granata went on to train as an actor and has now finally found a way to combine his love of London and performing as a tour guide, sharing his admiration and zest for the city through engaging story-telling."

Zoom joining info will be sent out to bookers a day or so before the tour. \n \nAll walking tours 20 max. Pre book only."
