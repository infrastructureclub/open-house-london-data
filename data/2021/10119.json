(Ill. 3)  The finalised plan for Ethelburga Estate, circa 1960, shows the future Ethelburga Tower as a 23 storey block of 123 flats in an estate of generally four storeys. (Ills 4,5,6)   The plan  was revised in 1964 with the height of Ethelburga Tower reduced to 17 storeys with 98 flats to lessen its impact on surrounding areas.   (Ills 7,8)",

The main element delayed was the future Ethelburga Tower, to whose height local residents had objected. A tribunal upheld their case, forcing the LCC to lop off six storeys. \n‘This means that 32 families who are at present badly housed will lose their chance of a decent home’, grumbled the Housing Committee’s chairman. Otherwise the construction phase seems to have gone well, most of the estate being occupied in 1965."
