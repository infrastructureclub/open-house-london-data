A large cast iron gantry moves along the top of the cornices. Gas bags housed in 5 circular cast iron castings supplied gas to 5 'Humphrey' gas pumps housed in deep brick lined pits of which 2 remain in situ.",

The pumps, the invention of H A Humphrey, dispensed with the usual pistons, flywheels etc. and were provided with their momentum by the free movement or oscillation of water between pump and tower. They are the first example of their type in the world. They were used up until the late 1960's when they were replaced by electric pumps.",
