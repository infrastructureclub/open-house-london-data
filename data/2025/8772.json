                "There are only a handful of social (formerly working men’s) clubs left in London. The Mildmay Club on Newington Green, with its combination of a long radical history, an attractive building, and the extensive and unique facilities stands head and shoulders above all others. It is a building and a tradition that the current committee and membership is keen to preserve.",
                "The Mildmay Club is illustrative of the social and historical trajectory of working men’s clubs. As its original name (Mildmay Radical Club) implies, it was founded as a radical political club within the Working Men’s Club and Institute Union (CIU). This had been founded in 1862 to promote an extension of the traditional ‘gentleman’s club’ to the working classes and to provide them with venues for both entertainment and self-improvement.",
                "The clubs were originally seen as augmenting Temperance Halls as a way of providing working men with an alternative to the evils of the public house and also followed on from the tradition of working class educational institutions like the Mechanics’ Institutes and  Lyceums. They were also, however, part of a tradition of radical political clubs largely derived from the Chartist movement of the 1830s.",
                "By the early 1880s the metropolitan working men’s clubs were broadly of two kinds: social clubs and political clubs. The larger radical clubs tended to be found in London, which in terms of numbers of clubs dominated the CIU.",
                "By the turn of the twentieth century, The Mildmay Club, although not one of the earliest, was recognised as one of the largest and most politically active of the capital’s working men’s clubs. They took part in debates and demonstrations on the political issues of the day, both national, such as the call for a legal eight-hour working day or home rule for Ireland, or local, including issues relating to London’s Board schools.",
                "The Club was particularly involved in its opposition to the Second Boer War (1899-1902), despite many of its members being called up to fight in South Africa as members of the volunteer reserves. The founding of a rifle club in 1902, in line with many others patriotically established following the experience of the Boer War, is perhaps indicative of a tension between the radical function of a club and its establishment role of shaping ‘good’ citizens. The Mildmay rifle club was particularly successful with 200 members, reflecting a relatively affluent membership as shooting was a comparatively expensive pastime.",
                "The heyday of the radical working men’s clubs lasted from the early 1880s to the start of the First World War after which their political influence declined and social functions within the clubs increased in importance. This change also marked a decline in the metropolitan domination of the working men's club movement.",
                "The Mildmay Club is one of the last surviving working men’s clubs in the capital and its history and fabric illustrates the political aspect of such clubs, the early metropolitan dominance and the later pre-eminence of its leisure functions."

            "paragraphs": [
                "Architecturally, The Mildmay Club is designed in the revival Queen Anne style, one that provided a dignified historicist frontage for institutional buildings from the late-Victorian period. The interior retains its original plan, form and character to a high degree and includes the common features of a working men’s club/institute of the period, such as a large and impressive theatre/hall, secondary hall, snooker room, bar, reading room and caretaker’s accommodation.",
                "Historic photographs show that the interior included lavish tile work, particularly to the entrance passage, along with murals in the theatre which may have survived beneath later finishes. The later finishes, mainly dating from the 1970s, and some minor changes to the layout of the building, in particular the additional bars to the Main and Small Halls, are illustrative of the fundamental changes in working men’s clubs with the increased importance of entertainment functions in the post-war era.",
                "The Mildmay Club represents a very rare survival of a large, purpose-built, metropolitan working men’s club from a radical tradition, retaining its function as a social club. Historic England notes that the building also has group value for its contribution to a group of buildings reflecting the long radical and nonconformist tradition of Newington Green. These include the Unitarian Chapel and number 54, home to the eighteenth century radical minister Dr Richard Price and visited by Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, David Hume, Adam Smith and Mary Wollstonecraft (both buildings  listed at Grade II).",
                "The Mildmay Club was founded on 18 August 1888 as the Mildmay Radical Club and was originally located at 36 Newington Green Road, Islington. The club was actively involved in radical politics and social campaigns. In 1894 it moved to new premises at 34 Newington Green, gifted in the will of two local sisters. Newington Green was already an area with a long tradition of religious dissent and radicalism. Membership of the club rose from 1,000 in February 1896 to 2,400 in January 1899, eventually peaking at 3,000 members. The Mildmay Club was recognised as one of the largest and most politically active of the capital’s working men’s clubs.",
                "On 27 October 1900 the foundation stone was laid for a new clubhouse designed by a member of the Club, the architect Alfred Allen. The new building, which may have incorporated fabric from the existing houses on the site, included two halls, a reading room, meeting rooms and a billiard hall. In 1907 (and again in 1921), the rifle range was added to the facilities of the club. The rear hall was extended to the east, possibly at this time. In 1930 it changed its name to The Mildmay Club and Institute, and became non-political. In line with many working men’s clubs it concentrated on providing entertainment facilities for its members and by the 1950s it staged weekly variety shows. The building was renovated in the 1970s."

                "In 2025, The Mildmay Club is growing in membership, diversifying in events and activities and we currently have almost 3,000 members. The weekly entertainment for members and guests includes bingo and live jazz every Friday and there are darts and snooker leagues and competitions throughout the year. The Club hosts a wide range of entertainment for its Members including live bands, regular discos, young people's band sessions, comedy nights, a variety of world music, regular vintage markets, film screenings and weekly Zumba classes. \n \nThe Mildmay Club is an incredibly popular location for the film and television industry, and it is from here that much of the Club’s income is derived – and why some of the interiors may seem familiar.\n \nWe are very proud of the supporting role that the Club has played, from award winning blockbusters like Judy and Legend, to popular franchises like Sky Atlantic’s Save Me, Unforgotten, and Gangs of London. The Club was used as a location by Sir Steve McQueen for his feature film Blitz and the Amy Winehouse biopic Back to Black was filmed at the Club. More recently, Guy Ritchie used the Club as a location for his forthcoming feature film Dog and Wife, starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Anthony Hopkins. It has featured in many television productions including Killing Eve, This Way Up, Call The Midwife, The Day of the Jackal and Baby Reindeer and has recently been the location for the latest BBC series of Uncanny.",
                "The Club is also frequently used by high end fashion brands such as Gucci, Paul Smith, Prada, Louis Vuitton and JW Anderson for photo shoots and commercials, videos and online content for other brands. Editorial has included a Kate Moss and Ray Winstone photo shoot for Perfect magazine, the Observer Magazine featuring actor Daniel Mays and Declan Rice for Men's Health magazine.",
                "Independent and major record labels have used the Club for a diverse range of music videos from live music sessions from breakthrough artists through to John Legend, The Smile (directed by Paul Thomas Anderson), Fontaines DC and MRCY.  Oasis recently shot a commercial film for Adidas at the Club.",
                "The income from filming is vital and enables us to keep maintaining and restoring this Grade II listed Asset of Community Value. Over the last few years we have replaced all our roofs, also restoring our roof lantern and cupola to its former glory (which can be seen from Newington Green), refurbished brick and stonework, renovated the Tartan Bar to the side of the Main Hall including a fully functioning bar, replaced the building's hot and cold water supply and electrical wiring as well as carrying out structural remedial works and important fire safety and accessibility upgrades. We have replaced the windows at the front of the building with timber framed casement windows to the original detail. We are in the process of completing works to form a separate residential access to the former committee room and Club Steward accommodation on the second floor that has not been in use since the 1980s. The works will create three flats on the second floor and will provide regular income for the club from 2026. We are aiming to improve accessibility to the Main Hall with a new stairlift in the near future. All within the limits of our Grade II listing."
