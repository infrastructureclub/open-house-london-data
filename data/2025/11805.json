Once nestled between the arms of the River Tyburn as it flowed into the Thames, Thorney Island played a crucial role in the early development of London. This talk will uncover the island’s transformation from a secluded monastic settlement to the seat of royal and political power. Learn how the landscape has changed over the centuries, why the island disappeared from maps, and what traces of it remain today."

It is in Old Pye Street at the centre of what was a hotbed of squalor and criminality that Charles Dickens dubbed “The Devil’s Acre”. It is on the actual site of a former school for pickpockets - almost certainly the inspiration for Fagin’s Den."
