There are memorials to some of those killed on the site on the north wall of Saint Bartholomew's Hospital.\nThe City of London gained market rights for the site under a charter granted by Edward III in 1327.\nIn 1852 the Smithfield Market Removal Act was passed and the livestock market was relocated to a new site at Copenhagen Field, Islington. This was followed in 1860 by the Metropolitan Meat and Poultry Act which led to the construction of new buildings on the site."

Above the sidings the East and West Market buildings were erected and the whole complex was completed in a year.\nThe new buildings were opened in a grand ceremony headed by the then Lord Mayor, James Lawrence, on 24th November 1868.\nSuch was the success of the market that a third building was added in 1873 and adjacent to the market the Port of London Authority built cold stores to store meat being imported through their docks. \nThe General Market and Annexe were added in 1879."

There is a memorial plaque in Grand Avenue adjacent to the war memorial to commemorate them and their sacrifice. \nIn 1962 a new building was built to replace the destroyed structure; designed by Ove Arup and Partners it was every bit as cutting edge and revolutionary as the original. It boasts one of the largest pre-stressed concrete domed roofs in Europe if not the world."
