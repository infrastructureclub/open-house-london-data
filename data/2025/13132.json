The project is a unique example of how a property can be repurposed in new and surprising ways, respecting but boldly transforming the original fabric.\nThe hotel’s social ethos is enhanced through the porosity of the spaces; theatricality heightened by glimpsed and reflected views, inviting further exploration. The marble-floored courtyard is the social hub, offering an appreciation of the whole environment. Branching out from this centre, the new circulation arrangement stitches together elements of the original building with simply detailed new components.\nAbove the ground floor social hub is a private first floor terrace surrounded on all sides by a three-storey hanging garden of jasmine and passion flowers."
