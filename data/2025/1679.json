You'll also have the unique opportunity to go behind the scenes and visit artists' studios on Maker Street, discovering where new works and ideas are developed.",

Somerset House's resident culinary community, including our new riverside bar and restaurant Setlist, will offer bespoke food and drink throughout the weekend. Don't miss this rare chance to discover the hidden secrets of our historic building and experience its creative energy firsthand.",
