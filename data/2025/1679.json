                "The weekend will be filled with a diverse program of free, family-friendly events, installations, performances, and workshops. Highlights include a pop-up basketball installation, immersive disco experiences from the CUTE exhibition, and drawing workshops inspired by our beloved Peanuts exhibition. You'll also have the unique opportunity to go behind the scenes and visit artists' studios on Maker Street, discovering where new works and ideas are developed.",
                "Experience a new large-scale sculpture from Turner Prize-winning artist Tai Shani and installations in lesser-known spaces like The Deadhouse and Maker Street from Somerset House Studios residents such as Nick Ryan and GAIKA. Somerset House's resident culinary community, including our new riverside bar and restaurant Setlist, will offer bespoke food and drink throughout the weekend. Don't miss this rare chance to discover the hidden secrets of our historic building and experience its creative energy firsthand.",
                "As night falls, don’t miss Waterloo Bridge glowing “Somerset House Blue” as part of Illuminated River.",
                "Thank you to 886 by The Royal Mint who are our Innovation Supporter across the weekend."
