The original tower (1703) by Meard was deemed unsafe and replaced by the existing tower by Cockrell (1811) which contains the clock's hand wound mechanism. Only the tower, and adjacent St Anne's House, survived the bombing in 1940. Rebuilt in 1990 as a multi-function community space and chapel with the entrance enhanced and refurbished following a competition with students from Central St Martins College of Art in 2016, winning the Church Architecture of the Year Award."
