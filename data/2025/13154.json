It charts the development of institutions in response to intense social and economic change to shape the city we know today. We will celebrate the visible reminders of this history in the streets around us and ask: why does this matter to Londoners today?",

We will travel from the early parish vestries to the Victorian Metropolitan Board of Works, onward to the London County Council and the Metropolitan Boroughs, and through to the boroughs that we know today."

                "Choosing this area is, in part, an attempt to bring back into our consciousness the Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell (1900 to 1965). It once covered much of what we now know as Southwark: from the Old Kent Road in the north to Peckham in the east, and down to Crystal Palace in the south. However, like many of the 28 metropolitan boroughs that governed inner London during a pivotal 65 years in the city's history, these bodies – and their often pioneering, progressive legacies – were written out of history by a stroke of the administrative pen with the abolition of the London County Council in 1965. Compact and rich in history, Camberwell is the perfect place to tell this undertold story of London's local government."

For the most part, it is a history shaped more by circumstance than by design. As institutions rose and fell in influence over the years it became a story of politics, people, and power – one that can teach us much about how we live in and govern the city today."
