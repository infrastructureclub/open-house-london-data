However, the building is now open and is a much loved venue for both worshipful gatherings and community hirings and regularly hosts Open House days for our  Ukrainian refugees and all world asylum seekers, for which they have recently won a Civic Honours Award.",
                "It is hoped that the building itself reflects many of the Quaker values by adhering to simplicity, using all natural,  ethically sourced, sustainable and environmentally friendly materials.",
                "The building is designed to welcome the community to a peaceful, calming, light-filled building which was recently designated as a Building of Cultural Importance by the Council.",
                "The Quakers are a non-hierarchical organisation who have fought for human rights, free speech and equality for all for almost 400 years, and this is reflected in the central hall, a circular meeting room whose windows look out on both sky and gardens of assorted seasonal  wildflowers.",
                "Triple-glazed windows and double glazed doors, not only facilitate the certified sustainable environmental ventilation system, but also enable the Quakers to practice their worship in silence.",
                "Quaker testimony to sustainability was a priority when architect Stewart Dodd was chosen out of a field of 126 other candidates, as he  had such strong environmental credentials.  Consequently, the meeting house is Association for Environment Conscious Building (AECB) certified (‘Passivhaus’ standards of energy efficiency).",
                "The wood used throughout,  larch, oak and birch,  is Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified, and all carpentry demonstrates Shaker-like craftsmanship. The brick stock blends seamlessly with nearby houses, while the latticing and patterning manifest the beauty of that material.  In recognition of the excellence of our design and outstanding environmental building standards, The Hammersmith Society awarded us its 2021 Environmental Award.",
                "This building is all on one floor and is fully accessible for wheelchairs and buggies.",
                "The building will be open to visitors for the  Open House Festival as a Drop-In. This year we are also delighted to welcome Turning Pages to the Meeting House on Sunday 14th September between 2–4pm for one hour of silent reading all around the venue.  Turning Pages is unique book group that turn up at iconic venues all over the world and stage silent readings. There no need to book, during the hours of Saturday September  13th from 10am to 2pm and on Sunday 14th  from 12pm to 4pm."
