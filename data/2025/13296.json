The exhibition explores the evolution of the workplace by comparing it with other aspects of lifestyle — hospitality, residential clubhouses, F&B spaces, and retail — as a journey from public to private, passing through semi-public spaces. Using mixed media including pin-ups, sketches, material palettes, and digital tools, attendees will gain insights into the power of design to foster community spirit and improve wellbeing at work. Following the exhibition, which is open to everyone without registration, Conran and Partners will host a panel talk to gain further insights on the topic from leaders in the fields of design and placemaking."
