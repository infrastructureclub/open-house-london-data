It formerly stood in Fleet Street, marking the western boundary of the City of London and the place where the reigning monarch enters the City and is greeted by the Lord Mayor, in the Ceremony of the Pearl Sword.  After its removal in 1878, it was rebuilt on a country estate in Hertfordshire. The Temple Bar Trust acquired and re-located it in its present site on Paternoster Square in 2004. Temple Bar Trust is supported by the City of London Corporation. Temple Bar is now the Livery Hall of The Company of Architects."
