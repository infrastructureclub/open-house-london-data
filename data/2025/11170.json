He created large underground tunnels which took effluent to new pumping stations at Abbey Mills and Crossness. Balzagette’s sewers are still used in much of the city and are only now being supplemented by the Thames Tideway tunnels. His designs reshaped London; he created the Thames Embankments, redesigned several prominent river crossings such as at Hammersmith, Putney and Battersea, and created new streets and parks. Bazalgette's achievements are viewed as a major contributing factor for removing cholera and improving the health of Londoners."

                "The mausoleum was first built for John Anthony Rucker, a banker, merchant, and slave owner, who owned extensive coffee and sugar plantations in Grenada. His nephew, who inherited the estates upon his uncle’s death, sold the mausoleum and his estates shortly afterwards. There is no known connection between Bazalgette and Rucker, who died 20 years before Bazalgette was born. It is believed that Bazalgette bought the tomb for his family as there was no empty space available in the churchyard. Bazalgette is understood to have remodelled the tomb by replacing a pyramid top with a rising tower."
