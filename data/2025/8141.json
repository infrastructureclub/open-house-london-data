The oldest building in the borough, it stands at the heart of the first conservation area in the London Borough of Waltham Forest, Walthamstow Village. For over 900 years, the church has been at the centre of faith and community in Walthamstow. Every generation has updated the interior to suit the changing needs of the Church.",
                "The Churchyard which surrounds the building encloses three and one-third acres. There are approximately 26,000 burials; 16,000 since the mid 18th C are recorded in the registers. There are over 1300 monuments, including four Grade II listed tombs, with the oldest legible monument dated 1710."

Mounted on a column, one of these is a fine brass memorial to Sir George Monoux (died 1543) and his wife, Dame Mary. He was a significant benefactor of the church and local community, where adjacent almshouses and a nearby local sixth form college still bear his name. There are also two palimpsest brasses.\nThe earliest stone monument was erected in 1601 by Sir Edward Stanley in memory of his wife, Lady Lucy. The sculptor is thought to be William Cure II, later Master Mason to King James I.\nThe Merry monument of 1633 was intended by Sir Thomas Merry (a prominent Royalist) as a joint memorial to his wife\nand himself; the sculptor was Nicholas Stone, Master\nMason to King Charles I, and the verses are said to have been written by Sir William Davenant the Royalist poet.\nThe Trafford monument, erected in 1689, is the largest and most imposing monument in the church and is in the style of Grinling Gibbons.\nDesigned by James Humphries Hogan, the five lancet East Window, a memorial to Sydney Harris, dates from 1939 and is the work of James Powell & Sons (Whitefriars) Glassworks.",
                "The four Grade II listed tombs are: Wise (1710), Rigg (1754), Solly (1776) and Morley Wilson (1819). There are twelve Commonwealth War Grave Commission graves across the site. Many other fine and interesting monuments are to be found."

Outside, the car park has been turned into a landscaped public area for pedestrians to enjoy.",

The old entrance has been preserved and there is now a new glass door which allows more light through and is open in the day for visitors."
