                "The Law Society is the independent professional body for solicitors, representing, promoting and supporting over 180,000 members in England and Wales. The Society was founded in 1825 and was granted its Royal Charter in 1845. Renowned Swiss architect, Lewis Vulliamy was appointed to lead the design of the Law Society’s Hall at 113 Chancery Lane. The Hall itself was built as part of a new era of dominance and rise in standing of the solicitor in the early 19th century as the role became professionalised. The Law Society was first opened to its members in 1832 and is now a Grade II* listed building.",
                "The building was extended starting in 1902, with the design by Charles Holden, who is best known for his work on many London underground stations. The extension was officially opened by King Edward VII in 1904.",
                "The Law Society’s Hall also houses several impressive works of art, acquired over its 200-year history. These include a 13-panel frieze by Conrad Dressler, a World War One memorial by Gilbert Bayes, and tiles by the renowned ceramic artists, William de Morgan. The architect Lewis Vulliamy’s father and younger brother were renowned clockmakers, and there are six Vulliamy clocks on display within the Hall.",

To celebrate two hundred years of the Law Society, in 2025 we have launched an extensive yearlong programme throughout England and Wales, connecting with solicitors and members of the legal profession in their communities and promoting access to justice, the rule of law, and diversity and inclusion in the profession.  We have also launched a digital history exhibition, bringing these stories to life and celebrating the inspiring solicitors making history so that we can share our mission virtually and internationally. Now, for the first time in over a decade, we open our doors to the public and invite you to join us as we celebrate our bicentennial year."
