Now, 50 years later the charity has become a central pillar for the community, providing services to support people, adapting, changing and expanding to meet the next crisis (from mental health to food poverty and cost of living to digital exclusion).",

It is home to Somali Education Centre and the Eritrean Community in the UK as well as the many other community groups who deliver activities from the centre."
