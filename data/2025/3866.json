                "St. Lawrence Jewry is so called because the original 12th Century church stood near the site of an ancient synagogue and Jewish trading area, thus distinguishing it from the other St. Lawrence churches in the City of London.\n \nDuring the Second World war, the church was extensively damaged but not completely destroyed by an incendiary attack on 29 December 1940. Granted Grade I Listed status and restored by 1957, faithful to Wren’s original design, it is now the official Church of the Corporation of London and stands at the heart of the City of London as a place of peace and sanctuary from the busy city life.",
                "Like many Wren Churches few walls are at right angles but this \"sumptuous barn\", with its glowing white and gold  interiors, and one of the best examples of mid-20th Century stained glass, is spectacular.
