Although the house was demolished in 1964, several outbuildings survived, including the Walled Garden, Coach House, Stables, and notably the Dovecote.",
                "The Dovecote, likely from the 17th century, is a circular brick building that housed pigeons, an important food and manure source. It symbolized the status of landowners, as only certain classes could maintain dovecotes. Featuring a conical roof and interior nesting boxes, the Grade II listed building was restored in the early 2000s after falling into disrepair.",
