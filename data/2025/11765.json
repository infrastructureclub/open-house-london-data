Following years of unsympathetic alterations, EPR’s design re-establishes the lost grandeur of this impressive five-storey Victorian building whilst making bold interventions that safeguard its future as a viable workplace — providing a variety of spaces tailored to the needs of our design teams that reflect and enable our collaborative style of working.",
