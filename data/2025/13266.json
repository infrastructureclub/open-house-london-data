This section of the building was demolished and rebuilt in the 1960's and is now occupied as residential properties. Much of the original building heritage was lost in the changes of ownership and use over the years, but our architects IF_DO, working on a major retrofit of the building, are working with local people to develop new artwork and architectural detailing that reflect the buildings heritage and the local area."
