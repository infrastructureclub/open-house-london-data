                "Atomik’s sensitive refurbishment has uncovered the original character of the building, reworking it as an asset to the school. The jumbled sequence of internal spaces has been knitted back together and a contemporary art studio extension has been designed to support the wider curriculum and connect the building to the main school and landscape.",
                "Every resident of Thorpe Lodge has added a layer of their own history to the building. Today it is for Holland Park School to add its own chapter. In doing so it has brought Thorpe Lodge back into use to be enjoyed by pupils, staff and the public."

First of all the school needed a reconfigured entrance to provide a more inviting sense of arrival; secondly bringing Thorpe Lodge back to its former glory and; thirdly to extend the building to create a new art studio\nThe project transforms the problematic empty building into an asset central to the school.",
                "The new entrance reconnects the school to the street and creates a more welcoming sense of arrival. The refurbishment works make the building perfect for community uses and the art studio extension knits this fabulous building back into the heart of the school’s curriculum.",
                "The school’s leadership team set a demanding open brief that required both innovation and commitment from the whole project team. From the design of the new Baubuche roof structure, the technical development and prototyping of the dynamic painting screens, to the coordination and integration of modern building services within the context of the listed building. What would initially seem like a simple building, is actually the result of rigorous and methodical coordination of every moment, service and junction."
