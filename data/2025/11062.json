                "Since opening in 2017, OmVed Gardens have worked to share knowledge and host experienced voices\nin urban growing and ecology, nature led creativity, wild learning and regenerative kitchen practices.",
                "Through sustainable events and conferences and community outreach the organisation has welcomed\nglobal voices in indigenous knowledge, expertise in growing and soil health and developed community\ngroups of all ages.",
                "Now the new dedicated spaces on site will allow the gardens to remain open year round introducing\nsustainably designed buildings to transform the potential of this popular destination.",
                "Developing an earlier design plan from former architectural practice HASA, Piers Smerin of Smerin\nArchitects has designed a series of buildings that embrace the open access welcoming ethos of OmVed\nGardens whilst creating sustainable technically innovative spaces with a unique silhouette. The buildings\nframed in Douglas Fir and clad in Western Red Cedar mostly share a pyramid like profile with the\nexception of the kitchen building which hosts an accessible rooftop garden. Exposed timber beams with\ningenious framing support welcoming honest spaces as raised roofs provide a natural ventilation akin to\ntraditional oasthouse and dovecot designs. Passive design principles informed the build with sustainable\nmaterials used as much as is practically possible while placement on site has been considered to\nmaximise passive solar gain during the winter months.",
                "Landscape architect Paul Gazerwitz was responsible for the original rejuvenation of the landscape at\nOmVed Garden creating a series of pathways down the hillside linking the buildings together with lush\nand carefully organised planting. The new hillside landscaping is designed to create a wooded area\ncomplementing the existing garden spaces including the wildflower meadow, permaculture vegetable\ngarden, ponds, willow circle and orchard. As it matures, the tree planting will both create an element of\ndiscovery approaching the buildings giving a sense of a rural village while the network of paths are\ndesigned to facilitate chance meetings and interactions between visitors to the buildings.",
                "The organisation’s mission to work holistically across food, creativity and ecology, and their impact on\nhealth, climate education and community wellbeing continues to facilitate global connections with the UN\nWorld Food Programme and The Chefs’ Manifesto whilst also building relationships with the local\ncommunity through a series of events and workshops."
