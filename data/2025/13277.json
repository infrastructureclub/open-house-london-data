                "One Paved Court first appears on the map somewhere between 1690- 1720. It is on a narrow pedestrian lane off Richmond Green.  In the early 20th century it was a shop house lived in by a surgical appliance maker and his family. It was Grade 2 Listed around 1969, and since then has been a pet shop and a carpet shop amongst other things. \nThe building was poorly refurbished in the 1970s and split into a rabbit warren of spaces  and was unoccupied for the 10 years before we acquired it in 2016.",
                "Allies and Morrison Architects  spent a year stripping out the damage, such as upvc windows, and have made as few new interventions as as possible. \"We were there to repair the fabric and to nudge it into its new role.  Perhaps the most surprising discovery was an intact half-timber-and-brick party wall, previously concealed behind a much later chimney breast.\"",
                "Since 2017, One Paved Court has been run as an artist-led gallery with an attic studio for the resident artists.  It has been incredibly exciting to see how all the  exhibiting artists respond directly to the building's layered fabric as they create and exhibit their work within it."

                "During London Open house , One Paved Court will house an exhibition: Time & Tide by London artist Nicki Rolls.",
                "The exhibition is a recognition of the tidal River Crane and its bordering plants through charcoal drawings, paintings, sculpture and video",
                "Nicki Rolls has just completed a two-year art residency on the tidal section of the River Crane and the adjacent Northcote Nature reserve in Twickenham, on the opposite bank of the Thames to Richmond. She has been making observations from the diverse habitats that envelop the river and nature reserve. She explores wildflowers and weeds that live in inhospitable urban environments, celebrating these often overlooked and rejected plants and inviting the viewer to consider our human relationship with plants and the natural world. Time & Tide presents her charcoal drawings, paintings, sculpture, and video responding to her experience of both the river and its bordering plant life.",
                "Through large-scale charcoal drawings, Rolls captures the physical and emotional character of plants often dismissed as weeds. Her charcoal drawings – marked by smudges, underdrawings, and fragile textures – render blemishes, broken stems, and decaying leaves, as a record of the stresses of living and ageing of the plant. She often includes tangled roots and soil remnants, revealing the struggle for survival as both beautiful and vital.",
