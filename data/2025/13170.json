                "Garage Gallery is located in what was the garage on the ground floor of our house in Walthamstow, east London.  The house dates from the late 19th Century, and it’s  located in a residential street adjacent to the conservation area of Walthamstow village.  \nThe creation of the Gallery began as a ‘lockdown project’ to refurbish our under-used and very tatty garage space.  We’re both enthusiastic about visiting art galleries wherever we are, and very soon had the idea of using the front of the garage as a ‘window gallery’.  Luckily, we realised before committing time and money to this that the position of the window means that anything displayed in it would have been impossible to see from the street!   But, the idea of bringing artworks into a very different setting to a traditional gallery had taken hold, and we created a simple ‘white cube’-type space within the garage itself, including a professional hanging system and basic facilities for use by curators and visitors.\nSince our pilot show in October 2022 we have hosted 16 varied shows, usually group shows of 3 artists or more, ranging from those just starting out to those with more experience.  The offer has included 2D and 3D works in a range of media, sound and video-based work, workshops and a charity events.  \nWe run the gallery on a not-for-profit basis and open it a few times a year – it is part of our home and we have busy jobs and lovely neighbours to think about!   But we’re proud of being a small part of Walthamstow’s artistic community and doing something to support artists, and those who like viewing art."
