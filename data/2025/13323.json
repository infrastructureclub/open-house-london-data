The exhibition builds on the Lockdown Space Collection which invited people to post images/films online that shared how they had adapted, re-imagined, transformed and expanded their home environment during lockdown.",
                "For so many at this time everyday domestic space came under intense pressure to simultaneously function as the space for people to work, socialise, exercise, learn, create, entertain, play and escape. The exhibition reveals how people carried out makeshift and adhoc interventions to their homes to generate new dynamic, flexible and multi-functional spaces. The once traditional enclosed spaces of privacy and safety now perform as the office, the gym, the school, the studio, the pub, the club, the campsite, the restaurant, the beach and spaces of the imagination.",
                "We invite you into the physical space of a house which spatially reframes and recontextualises the collection to critically reconsider the ideal home in our increasingly unsettled times. As part of the exhibition you will have the opportunity to engage with the collection and contribute to The Ideal Home Catalogue for Lockdown Living."
