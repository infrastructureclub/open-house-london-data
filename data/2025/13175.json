                "The Old Church owes its origins to Stoke Newington’s sixteenth century Lord of the Manor, William Patten. In 1563 he decided to rebuild the old parish church, which had become almost derelict. You can see the date, and the motto ‘ab alto’ (‘from above’), above the main door.\nThe main surviving structure from Patten’s time is the south aisle which appears to have been designed as a private chapel for himself and his family. The red brickwork on the walls and the arcade separating the chapel from the nave date from Patten’s time.",
                "The Old Church was heavily bombed during the London Blitz of October 1940 but repairs were quickly carried out and services, including weddings, were held here from Christmas of that year.\n \nFurther post-war repairs included the removal of most of the nineteenth century box pews. A few remain to this day – so you can experience how uncomfortable they were to sit in!"
