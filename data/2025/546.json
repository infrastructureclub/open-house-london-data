In the 1980s it was one of the first alternative comedy venues.\n \nIn 2001 the theatre was closed for restoration. The theatre was built around the Britannia pub on the corner, which was rebuilt in 1954 after WW2 bombing. As the new pub was not listed it was knocked down and rebuilt as a café. The refurbishment cost of £17 million and was completed with help from Lord Alan Sugar, who also opened the restored theatre."
