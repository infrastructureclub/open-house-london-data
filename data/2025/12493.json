                "Our home is a semi-detached late Victorian house situated on a wide street in a leafy neighborhood at the border of Wandsworth and Putney. Originally, the house suffered from a lack of natural light and a compartmentalized layout, but it held great potential for transformation.",
                "We embarked on an extensive renovation, stripping the interior, demolishing the back extension, and redesigning half of the original staircase. The loft extension was a major addition, significantly expanding the living space. The only external hint of these changes from the front are the luminous windows hinting at the expansive openings at the back.",
                "Inside, a continuation of the original staircase ascends through two stories of structural glass, connecting a large skylight prism to a two-way mirror, which reflects the lush garden while providing privacy for the shower situated behind it. This skylight allows daylight to flood the house, creating a bright and welcoming atmosphere. The nearly open-plan ground level features a double reception room that flows into the kitchen, with light freely bouncing throughout.",
                "The rebuilt back extension appears to hover over the kitchen, pushing the boundaries of indoor and outdoor space. Two glass envelopes extend the living area, with a sloping glass roof on the north-facing side framing an existing Victorian door and enhancing its quality. At the far end, a large opening extends into the garden, with materials that seamlessly blend the indoor and outdoor spaces.",
                "On the loft level, a grand master bedroom suite with a balcony offers views of the garden and the opposite row of houses, reflecting the morning sun. The dormer, clad in thin larch slats, continues the abstract language of pure volumes found throughout the house. Above, a sun deck provides a panoramic view of the Church Tower on Santos Road and the surrounding area.",
                "Additional Information:",
                "Level Access: The main entrance and ground floor are accessible. The upper floors are only accessible by stairs.\nParking: Accessible street parking is available nearby. Pay and display\nFacilities: There is an on-site toilet, but it is not advertised for public use.\nRefreshments: We will close for lunch and provide lunch and beverages for our volunteers. These are not available to the public.\nTour Nature: This is a walk-in, walk-out tour. We advise individuals with height vertigo to refrain from attending.\nThis tour offers a unique opportunity to explore the creative and practical aspects that went into transforming this Victorian house into a modern, light-filled home."
