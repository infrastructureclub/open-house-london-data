Starting in the mid-18th century, the district of Bloomsbury, stretching from New Oxford Street to Euston Road, has developed between museums, libraries and institutions of higher and further education – housing an astonishingly diverse range of objects, resources and specialized spaces for teaching and research. Their architecture reflects the values and aspirations associated with institutional scholarship in the centuries during which London has become a major centre of learning: from the High Imperial hellenism of Smirke’s British Museum, and the modernizing ambitions of Holden’s and Lasdun’s unfinished attempts to interject an architecturally unified campus into Bloomsbury’s Georgian squares, to the investment-driven regeneration of the contemporary ‘Knowledge Quarter’ around the Euston Road."
