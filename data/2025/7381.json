                "Marie’s Wardrobe is a carefully reworked Edwardian terraced house in Stoke Newington. The project explores how timber and plywood can be used to create new spatial clarity within the constraints of a modest home. A perforated stair, laser-cut from plywood, replaces the original sweeping stair and brings light, structure, and movement into the centre of the house.",
                "Design and Collaboration\nThe project was developed through close dialogue between architect and client. This collaboration is recorded in engraved texts embedded in the stair stringer, handrail, and a new internal screen wall—marking the conversation into the fabric of the building.",
                "Materials and Detail\nMuch of the original layout and materials have been retained, while new additions use plywood and timber to sit alongside rather than compete with the existing structure. A cantilevered timber balcony provides access to the garden without relying on heavy construction, preserving the lightness of the kitchen-dining area."
