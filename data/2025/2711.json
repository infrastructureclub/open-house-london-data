A 6.3 million pound investment in restoration has seen a transformation from previous use as council offices and a caf√© to a flexible community space which will celebrate the history of the hall and provide opportunities for local groups, commercial and community activities.\nBrockwell Hall includes newly repurposed spaces which draw on the history of the park and the local area, such as the Cressingham Suite named for the 18th century landowner Mercy Cressingham, the Blades Room named after the glass manufacturer who built the Hall in 1811 and the Bristowe Room named for local MP for Norwood Thomas Lynne Bristowe, a 19th century champion of open spaces who led a campaign for the creation of Brockwell Park as a public space.\nThe recent restoration of Brockwell Hall which opened in May 2025 was completed by PRS Architects following a community-led campaign by Brockwell Hall Community Partners, completed in partnership with Lambeth Council with funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund."
