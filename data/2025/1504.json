It is a membership organisation that works to ensure the public is better informed about the importance of eye health and the role of optometrists – your eye specialists on the high street.",
                "The College operates under Royal Charter for the public benefit and was founded in 1980 by amalgamating three existing examining bodies, through which it can trace its origins back to 1629. The story of professional eye care is told through the collections of the British Optical Association Museum displayed inside.",

                "Since 1997 the College has occupied this Grade II listed structure, combining two former residential properties designed by Henry Flitcroft (1687-1769) the architect of St. Giles in the Fields and Woburn Abbey. The street was originally laid out on the site of the former Spur Alley by Flitcroft as part of the Craven family's development of their Brewhouse Estate. It lay parallel to the Hungerford Market and ended in a timber yard, which was swept away, along with Thames-side oyster beds, when the Victoria Embankment was constructed in the 1860s. Numbers 41-42 were built by Charles Griffith ‘of the parish of Saint Martin-in-the-Fields … Joyner,’ and were leased to him on 31st January, 1729–30. 41 Craven Street is a typical Georgian terraced townhouse c.1730, with alterations dating from c.1792 when the 3rd floor was raised. Built of brown brick with red brick window dressings and a ground floor of channelled stucco, number 41 is the only house in Craven Street with segmental window arches.",
                "In the 1820s No 42 was occupied by John Barwise, 'Gentleman' and, fittingly for a future museum, No 41 housed John Coleman Isaac, 'dealer in curiosities', who imported telescopes, kaleidoscopes and optical toys as well as ceramics. In the 1880s the properties were split, including rooms for the physicians, Arthur and Robert Cross.",
                "Both properties then became private hotels and were often used by brides on the last night before their wedding at St. Martin-in-the-Fields. After Indian Independence, in 1947, no 41 was the original home of the India Club (later at 143 Strand) and was visited by Nehru. Twentieth century neglect and wartime bombing brought about a decline in status when the street was owned by Southern Railway. The basement of no. 41 became a refuge for stray cats and our neighbouring property, no 43 and all the houses to the north of it disappeared. In the 1980s the end of the block was renovated by Tarmac PLC who used 42 Craven Street briefly as a site office; no 42 was almost completely renewed and extended to the rear. The top floor (not open today) was added in 1991. A full building refurbishment was carried out in 2021-2025.",
                "The British Optical Association Museum, the oldest of its type in the world (established 1901) has been refurbished in stages since 2021, and September 2025 marks the culmination of that project.",
                "The property is allegedly haunted by two ghosts, George and Mary, who lived in the 18th century. There have been three independent 'sightings' in the past twenty years."

                "The forerunners of the College were:\n• The British Optical Association (BOA) – founded 1895, which ran the first ever professional examinations in optometry in 1896.\n• The Scottish Association of Opticians – founded 1922, which grew out of a consortium of jeweller-opticians, connected with Stow College in Glasgow.\n• The examining faculty of the Worshipful Company of Spectacle Makers. This London Livery Company, based at Apothecaries Hall and founded in 1629 had run examinations in ophthalmic optics since 1898. It is the only one of the founding bodies that still exists, albeit with altered functions.",
                "The BOA had previously occupied:\n• Cliffords Inn Hall (1914-1934) - the fourteenth century Inn of Chancery which was compulsorily purchased and demolished in 1934.\n• 65 Brook Street (1934-1978), which is now the Argentinian Embassy.\n• 10 Knaresborough Place, Earls Court (1979-1997). This became the first home of the newly-amalgamated College in March 1980. It is now a private health clinic."

Davidson, on behalf of all those who are interested in collecting the material evidence of our optical past. There are about 200 members from all over the world. Regular visits are arranged to museums and private collections, both in the UK and abroad. The OAICC has a its own collection of books held on deposit in the College Library, holds it meetings at the College and helps the museum in whatever way it can.
