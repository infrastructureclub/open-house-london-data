                "Noel Rees was a prominent house-builder who made a name for himself  in Petts Wood during the 1930's. His classic half-timbered, rural-romantic style with its predominant arts & crafts theme remains a stunning characteristic of his house-building. Creating a house for himself in the area, Rees had previously traveled extensively  and also had a passion for financing racing cars. In Petts Wood he created The Chenies an iconic private Cul-de-Sac now listed by Bromley Coucil as a conservation area."
