This is a rare chance to see original artwork that normally remains in private collection, brought together to celebrate the art of storytelling for children.\nSigned copies of first edition books will also be available for purchase.\nThis is a one-off event â€“ as the artwork is not permanently stored in this space, this exhibition will only be available for this event."
