                "Built in the 1820s, by 2012 the property had fallen into a state of disrepair. Bordering on dereliction, the building was  purchased at auction by James Wang and Alice Childs, who saw the potential to bring this cultural landmark back to life.",
                "Conservation works took place over the next 7 years, guided by an ambition to save as much existing material as possible, and making sensitive repairs where necessary. It was important for the house to remain first and foremost a dwelling – and not a museum, allowing it to remain in practical use as a home as well as a venue for artist residencies and exhibitions.",
                "Established as a site of creative production, 87 Hackford Road remains dedicated to preserving Van Gogh’s remarkable career while supporting the next generation of artists, writers, and designers.",
