                "Tooting Bec House by Draper Studio is a house refurbishment and double storey rear extension to a terraced Victorian house in South West London. Planning permission was granted for a larger scheme including a double storey front extension and a roof terrace atop the first floor rear bedroom pod at the back, however due to budgeting, these elements have not been implemented - just yet. The double storey rear extension is made out of Redwood, a general term for slow grown Swedish pine to unify the rear of the house and relocate the family kitchen and dining area towards the rear garden - a key part that was missing from the previous rear extension which it replaced. Above the new full width rear extension is a new double bedroom pod to add further accommodation and help the family skip a stamp duty cycle."
