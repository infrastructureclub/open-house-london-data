                "This building used to be the Library Resource Centre for the Borough of Ealing, but was refurbished by 2014 with funding from Ealing Council, the Social Investment Business, Arts Council England and others to create the IMPACT Community Arts Centre. It is a multi-use facility featuring areas for art, music, drama, dance/yoga and IT plus a cafe and a garden area. There have been further recent improvements to the building including improved lighting, CCTV, a new kitchen, and dressing rooms. We have a project ongoing currently to improve the garden. The building houses a day service (IMPACT Outreach Network) and a theatre company (IMPACT Theatre) for performers and artists with learning disabilities. IMPACT has been running for more than two decades. IMPACT Theatre was a recipient of the Queen's Award for Voluntary Service 2018."
