                "The College's official records of heraldry and genealogy are all in physical, manuscript form, dating from the present day all the way back to the College’s foundation in the late fifteenth century, and even earlier in some cases. To this day all of our records are painted and scrivened entirely by hand, just as they have been since the Middle Ages. Filled with beautiful artwork of armorial bearings, the College’s manuscripts form a unique and extensive record of social, political, cultural and artistic history."

                "The present College of Arms stands on a site which the Heralds have occupied since 1555. Derby House, the building which stood here then, was destroyed by the Great Fire of London in 1666. (Fortunately the manuscripts were saved, being transported by boat to Westminster.) The new College building was designed by Maurice Emmett, Master Bricklayer in the Office of Works, and erected in several stages between 1671 and 1688. An impressive example of Restoration architecture with grand interior spaces and fine period details, the College was further enhanced in the 1840s by the addition of its galleried Record Room, designed by architect Robert Abraham."
