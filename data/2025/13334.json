These buildings provide 157 high-quality homes, both market and social rented, nestled in a richly planted, fully accessible landscape. Visitors will learn how the site’s distinctive topography, including an 8m level change and its adjacency to the historic Surrey Iron Railway Scheduled Monument, directly informed the architectural and landscape design strategy.",
