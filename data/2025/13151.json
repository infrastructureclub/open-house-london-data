On the 130th anniversary of its construction, they have fully refurbished the interior of the Lock House to create a series of spaces to complement the remarkable and unique qualities of the main structure. Visitors will have the opportunity to experience the interior of the Lock House and enjoy its relationship with the main Lock & Weir structure that it is part of.

This creates a unique space within which to present a diverse mix of creative works and related arts. Currently there is an ongoing and diverse series of collaborative exhibitions, steered by the work of Astronaut Kawada. The series looks to test and provoke the balance of influence, awareness and potential within the natural and built habitats that we share. During Open House Festival 2025, there will be a collaborative exhibition with photographer Tom Lee. His work will include a 10 year study of the landscape of The South Downs, presented alongside the architectural work of Astronaut Kawada, also located and responding to the same landscape."
