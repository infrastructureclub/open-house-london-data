Some of the Art Deco era buildings that JB Priestley thought \"seemed to be merely playing at being factories\" are now listed as part of our architectural heritage.  Others are now lost, sometimes in notorious circumstances. Hear about the history of this well-known arterial road from a Local Historian who has written a recent and well-received book on Brentford's by-pass road."
