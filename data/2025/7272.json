The building work was funded entirely by donations from the Polish community, who had settled in the UK during and after World War ll, and a number of UK-based Polish organisations.",
                "Built between 1971 and 1974, the building is a fine example of brutalist-style architecture, and the largest Polish cultural centre in Europe outside of Poland, with many Polish organisations choosing to have their headquarters offices here.",
                "The Poles who settled in the UK during and after the War consisted in the main of military veterans and their families, those who had been forcibly deported to the far reaches of the Soviet Union, and those who had suffered under Nazi occupation. They either chose not to return to Poland following the country’s take-over by the Communists, because they knew they would face certain imprisonment or even sentence of death by the new authorities, or could not go back as their homes in the Eastern Territories had now been absorbed into the Soviet Union, so were in effect, refugees."

                "The theatre, which opened in 1982, maintains a rich cultural programme of both Polish and English events - plays, concerts, ballet and opera.  A more recent addition is the Jazz Café, which opened in 2005, and maintains a varied programme of music events. Indeed, its Saturday night concerts are sold out most weeks!",

With a newly-installed transparent roof, this is a multi-purpose performance and exhibition area.
