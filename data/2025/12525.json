                "The building forms a distinct part of the historic Admiralty complex of buildings that includes The Admiralty or  Ripley Building (1723-6) which is fronted by the Admiralty Screen (1759-60), Admiralty House (1788) and also Admiralty Arch (1908-11) and the Citadel (1940-41).",
                "OAB was designed as a purpose-built government office block comprising part of the Admiralty in the 1890s and built in three separate phases from 1894 until its completion in 1905.",
                "OAB replaced earlier townhouses that by the 1880s were too small to accommodate the growing number of civil servants.",
                "The building was designed by the architectural firm of Leeming and Leeming which comprised two brothers - John and Joseph Leeming from Halifax.",
                "The building was refurbished between 2014 and 2020 with the project led by BDP and the main contractor, Wilmott Dixon Interiors. This work included major structural alterations, asbetos management, instillation of new chillers that were craned into the courtyard as well heritage conservation work and the covering and removal of around 400 oak doors.",
                "OAB has been at the centre of history. For instance, it was in this building that Briitsh naval intelligence devised the plot known as \"Operation Mincemeat\" to fool Hitler and the Germans about the invasion of Sicily.",

It can trace its orgins back to 5th December 1899 when Reginald Baliol Brett, the Permanent Secretary to the Office of Works, wrote to Sir Francis Mowatt, the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury asking to spend £150 to buy five artworks for the Foreign Office as a way to brighten up tired looking government offices.",
