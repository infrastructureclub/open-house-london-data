                "Built in 1932 by architects Bradshaw Gass & Hope. Broadway started as an extension to the original gothic style town hall that has since been demolished. This gives the theatre a highly unique blend of architectural elements including Art Deco, Tudor and Gothic Revival.",

                "During its initial years it was hired by local organisations who held regular orchestral concerts and dances. When WWII started in 1939 the theatre auditorium floor was strengthened to be used as an air raid shelter. The building was also used as a telephone exchange and ration distribution centre.",
                "After the war and throughout the 1950s and 1960s the venue saw stars come to perform from all over the UK and USA.",

It has remained a landmark feature of Lewisham’s architecture for over half a century and deserves praise as one of South London’s best theatre and entertainment venues.",
