Originally manufactured by the Japanese RISO Kagaku Corporation in 1986, Risos were popularly used by schools, prisons, churches, political and activist groups to mass produce posters, flyers, pamphlets and small books. The machineâ€™s unique effects are great for both text and illustration, and with soy-based inks and masters made from banana paper great for the environment too."
