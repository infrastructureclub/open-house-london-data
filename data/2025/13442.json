                "Join Neal Vaughan (local artist and experienced visual arts teacher) to create a large celebration of drawing in Croydon’s Queens Gardens. This join-in event will bring people together through drawing the buildings and surrounds within the park. The park itself is a small, quiet place for a quick escape from the city life featuring a central fountain and sunken flower garden. It is surrounded by the buildings of that city life, but within the graden this is juxtaposed with nature.\nYou will draw the building and nature together, reflecting on what it is like to live in a city like Croydon, and be guided by Neal (a professional plein-air artist) on how to create using simple tricks and fun ways of looking and seeing what is around you. This is an event for all the family, providing a fun space for those not experienced or very experienced at drawing, to explore drawing in a relaxed atmosphere. There will be individual spaces to draw, plus a large collaborative drawing to join in, were you will be encouraged to draw on top of and add to others drawing, creating a more abstract and collaborative piece."
