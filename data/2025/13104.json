                "In the early 1990s, Croydon Council's undertook a bold Â£30 million project which refurbished parts of the  Grade II listed Town Hall and sympathetically added a large new central library, at the back of the building.  This meant that former Town Hall areas that included library facilities and court rooms could be re-purposed, as arts venues which opened in 1995. The project created a striking new library, but this tour will focus on the project's final phase; an arts complex that offered a striking blend of Victorian and modern architecture. It was described by Time Out as \"The jewel in Croydon's crown\", but most cultural activity (including the David Lean Cinema) was suspended in 2011 due to major cuts to the Council's arts budget."
