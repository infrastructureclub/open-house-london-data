He succeeded his father (who had designed the Old Grammar School in Gallery Road) as Architect and Surveyor to the Dulwich College Estate in 1858, and was in turn succeeded by his son Charles Edward Barry on his death.  Barry was President of the Royal Institute of British Architects from 1876-9, and his prize of the Gold Medal in 1877 cited two particular works: the New College at Dulwich, and the Piccadilly façade and the forecourt of the Royal Academy at Burlington House, with the premises of the learned societies.",
                "Barry was responsible for designing two churches on the Estate: St Peter’s, Lordship Lane (with some fine red brick and terra cotta roundel work in the interior) and St. Stephen’s, College Road, as well as some villas and railway buildings, including the viaducts at Herne Hill.  Elsewhere Barry designed nine churches and several country mansions."

Ruskin called the Charterhouse at Pavia ‘painful and pitiful’, ‘exhausting and encrusting’, reminding him of inlaid cabinets and velveted caskets.  Even Barry’s younger brother Edward Middleton Barry in a professorial Royal Academy lecture called the Charterhouse ‘fantastic’ and ‘not to be commended’.  Critic in Building News, 1869, said the cloisters were too low, and made fun of Barry’s roofscape with its ‘fussy erections’: ‘Chinese pagodas are temperate in comparison with the little pearshaped roofed temples set around with queer terminals, like bottles in a cruet stand’.  However, the Campanile itself and the ironwork to the Gate were admired."

It was designed by Grimshaw Architects, completed in 2016 and awarded an RIBA National Award in 2017.",
                "The Laboratory as “a home for Science and a venue for the Arts”, is an expression of the College’s commitment to dismantling the artificial divide between the two disciplines.",
                "The ﬁrst phase opened in April 2015 consisted of 18 fully equipped laboratories, three preparation rooms and the James Caird Hall. The second phase was completed in July 2016 with three laboratories for the Lower and Junior Schools, ﬁve adaptable ‘Informatics’ suites with free-thinking spaces for creative learning and cross-curricular collaboration, a seminar room with full video conferencing facilities, a versatile 250-seat auditorium and an outdoor piazza for recreation and performance.",
                "In shades of terra cotta and concrete representing order in nature and the unity of learning, the recurring pattern of the façade connects The Laboratory with the rich colours of Barry’s iconic ‘New College’ while making its own statement. The building’s footprint wraps around two large internal spaces and is deliberately stepped back and placed in a setting which integrates with other buildings on the campus. A sympathetic planting scheme complements and enhances the sense of openness and space which is integral to the College’s landscape plan.",

                "The design intentionally provides flexible spaces which enable a variety of conﬁgurations and layouts to future-proof the building against developments in technology and teaching. The laboratories are light and airy ‘boxes,’ a simplistic design, with desk and work surfaces laid out in a matrix pattern capable of being adapted to different forms of teaching.\n \nJames Caird Hall: Home to Shackleton’s life boat: ‘James Caird’, from the Endurance expedition of 1914-16, in which Shackleton with five companions crossed 870 miles of Antarctic winter waters and then crossed icy mountain terrain in South Georgia to raise the alarm and seek help for the 22 men marooned on Elephant Island.",

It is a pattern that occurs across the sciences and has inspired composers and artists to replicate the beauty and rhythms of the natural order in their work. Here is consolidates the intrinsic relationship between art and science.",

                "The sculpture builds on Shawcross’s work exploring Platonic solids and Conrad explicitly linked this commission to the 14 metre high sculpture on the plaza of the new Crick Institute at St Pancras. The ﬁnished work reflects the notion of a paradigm shift, understanding that in art and science we are often jolted forward into new ways of thinking and seeing.",
                "Sustainability is a core principle in the design of The Laboratory and the building uses innovative, environmentally inexpensive and energy-efficient systems. A ‘Thermally Active Building System (TABS)’ uses borehole water extracted at 12.8 °C from 65m-120m below ground, running through the ceilings and soffits of the building to extract heat, with the water emptying into a second borehole 100m away from the ﬁrst. This ‘Open Loop System’ uses ground source cooling rather than expensive and energy-inefﬁcient air conditioning, automatically delivering cooling on demand for individual rooms within the building. PV (photovoltaic) Solar Panels are ﬁtted on all available roof space generating some of the building’s electrical energy requirements."

Net zero carbon architecture is a long-held ambition of the school, having been targeted in the school’s 2011 masterplan. In response, the design of the library is informed by rigorous embodied and operational carbon analysis in combination with cost studies, leading to a hybrid structure of lightweight steel with composite steel and concrete floor decks.",
                "In counterpoint to Dulwich College’s august 1869 red brick main building by Charles Barry Junior – and in conversation with Grimshaw’s 2016 Laboratory building – alma-nac’s pale brick library marks a new gatepost to the school estate in the Dulwich Village conservation area. The three-storey building replaces a single-level portacabin in use since 1998 with two open and airy library floors united by a double-height atrium. A third level set back from the main frontage and clad in scalloped precast panels provides ICT learning spaces and a robotics suite.",
                "The new library establishes an independent identity and dedicated entrance for Lower School pupils aged 11–12 (year groups 7–8), defining a distinct neighbourhood within the ‘mini city’ of the wider school campus. Phase 2 of the project will creatively adapt and environmentally retrofit two adjoining post-war Austin Vernon & Partners buildings, establishing an open quadrangle of classrooms and collaborative learning spaces. Collectively the buildings will shelter an inner courtyard for play while also interacting with surrounding green landscape, including a learning allotment. The library’s double-height circulation will ultimately be extended across the campus by the addition of a new circulation spine to the north face of the main Lower School building, creating an intuitive flow of movement via generous and lofty cloisters.",
                "With a friendly face and human-scale proportions, the Lower School library acts as welcoming reception to the future campus, actively engaging children in school years 7 and 8 with the central role of library research in education and in life. The College Road elevation’s mix of deep-set windows angled at 45 degrees and boldly punched rectangular openings communicates glimpses of the inner working life of the school while a chequerboard section of textured brickwork expresses the building’s vertical circulation core.",
                "The library’s extended opening hours encourage children to use the space before and after school for homework and independent learning in an environment that provides direct physical and visual connections to play areas, the school’s central clock tower of the historic Barry building and surrounding playing fields.",
                "Extrapolating the principle of double-height circulation established by the library, Phase 2 of the project will provide a new hall for the Junior School, a wellbeing centre for the whole College and a new arts wing of music, art and design technology classrooms.",
                "The library will be made available to the local community for a wide range of events such as the Dulwich Literary Festival and more widely as part of the school’s commitment to the Southwark Schools’ Learning Partnership (SSLP). A community use agreement with Southwark Council established as part of the planning process formally recognises the arrangement.",
                "A learning landscape for the 21st century",
                "The school’s brief for the library called for a ‘non-sterile’ environment of robustly adaptable spaces where students can read, interact and learn in comfort. The space was also required to accommodate up to 100 people for gatherings for performance, music and social events. alma-nac’s flexible solution creates an environment where educators, students and visitors are encouraged to become co-learners and producers of knowledge as they engage in shared and individual activity.",
                "At ground level the library anticipates a range of modes of learning and usage scenarios, with mobile book display shelves and furniture configurations adaptable to day-to-day group learning, lectures, debates and discussions. A threshold of quarry tiles and the slatted timber balustrade and underbelly of the mezzanine level invest a warm, robust and earthy materiality, echoing the timber-lined character of the Middle and Upper School’s historic Wodehouse Library. The gallery level provides further shelving and display areas for books, fitted carrels for quiet working, group working tables and reading nooks for concentrated study overlooking the school grounds, while the third level of ICT and robotics learning space is characterised by top-lit classrooms and exposed glulam roof beams.",
                "Reinforcing the knowledge hub as the nexus of the campus, the two library levels are linked by a sculptural precast concrete spiral stair ‘carpeted’ in oak treads and risers and providing a full stop to the double-height circulation that will ultimately extend across the campus. A separate and generous top-lit stairwell also links the new building with the soon to be retrofitted Lower School, with lift access in an adjacent core ensuring the new spaces are fully accessible.",
                "Co-design and using the building as a tool for learning",
                "Central to the design development is alma-nac’s participatory approach, which directly engaged pupils, librarians, teaching staff, and the school estate team with the design and sustainability goals of the project. Influenced by the Baupiloton Method of participatory design, alma-nac staged a series of interactive workshops with pupils and staff to further inform the school’s strategic design brief. To spark dialogue among the young pupils about the design features they would like to see in their new buildings, the architects used visual prompt postcards depicting inspirational outdoor spaces, circulation, library and learning spaces from across the world. Direct outcomes of the consultation included introducing more greenery and tree shading around existing buildings and embedding the library as a welcoming reception space for the Lower and Junior Schools.",
                "Working together on net zero",
                "alma-nac worked with sustainability consultant and services engineers Max Fordham to develop a comprehensive net zero carbon environmental strategy for the library that balances a fabric-first approach with a high level of operational energy efficiency, ensuring that the building is efficient to heat in winter and easy to keep cool in summer.",
                "Achieving  a BREEAM Excellent rating, the Library combines low-embodied carbon and Passivhaus principles with energy modelling, renewable technologies and a creative approach to the services design to reduce operational carbon. Thermally enhanced facades, an airtight building envelope and natural cross-ventilation are complemented by an intelligent Building Management System developed in close consultation with the school’s Head of Sustainability, Katy Mills, and Sustainability Data Analyst, Luke George.",
                "From the outset of the Lower School project, Dulwich College recognised that ambitious adaptive reuse of the site’s structurally sound but outdated post-war buildings was key to its sustainability goals. The focus of Phase 2 of the project will be to complete the campus by transforming the concrete and steel framed Austin Vernon & Partners buildings with new functionality and life."
