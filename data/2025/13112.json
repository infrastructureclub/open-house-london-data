                "The original house had very steep stairs, was uninsulated and suffered from damp. In addition, there was very little connection between the main living area and the small rear garden.",
                "The project completely reconfigured the ground floor layout, to provide a much better connection to the garden and much more daylight in the living area. The stairs are now safer and comply with modern standards. A small toilet has been added upstairs and the whole building has been insulated, using a mixture of internal and external insulation.",
                "The very small site and some quite strict planning constraints meant that the layout needed careful consideration, in order to fit in all the functional requirements while creating an interesting and enjoyable space that is quite dramatically different from what existed before. These constraints also led to quite an unusual inverted roof structure over the new rear extension, constructed using steel and douglas fir timber.",
                "On view will be the main ground floor space and the small back garden. Although there is not fully level access, the main space can be accessed via one relatively small step."
