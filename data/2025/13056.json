Whereas, the more private bedroom and bathroom spaces occupy the ground floor and basement.  The form of the building creates two recognizable domestic envelopes shifted off each other. As a tight urban site, the design approach is inherently sculptural to allow each facade to meet different contextual challenges.  Apertures are strategically positioned to protect from over-heating and allow for the interior spaces to retain privacy and at the same time enjoying curated views of the cityscape.  Twin House is an experimental project for a contemporary family unit offering a reappraisal of cohabitation and collaboration."
