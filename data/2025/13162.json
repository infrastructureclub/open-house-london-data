                "Occupying a high-profile position overlooking the river Thames and iconic Tower Bridge, TBC.London is one of the capital’s first net zero refurbished buildings. The scheme achieved Practical Completion in mid-June and represents a landmark achievement in repurposing an existing building.",
                "TBC is a mixed-use building that breathes new life into a retained 1990’s structure.  Situated in \na prominent position adjacent to the historic and listed Tower Bridge and Accumulator Tower, the building’s new material palette reflects its location and enhances the surrounding area.",
                "The original building was stripped back to its concrete frame then extended with three new storeys that step back in response to neighbouring buildings and create landscaped terraces. The new brick façade sensitively references the site’s context within the Tower Bridge Conservation Area.  The service cores have been rationalised from three cores to two in new locations to open up the building. \n \nThe scheme has delivered a total of 10,616 sq m (GIA) of high-quality flexible Grade A Office space, an uplift of 753sq.m. with an additional 1,956 sq m (GIA) of flexible, ancillary commercial uses at basement.  Frontages at ground and first floor levels along both Shad Thames and Horselydown Lane have been vastly improved creating a welcoming and dynamic environment.",
                "This retrofit scheme has set new standards in what is possible in the repositioning existing building stock and the reuse of building materials.  Some 20 tonnes of 1930s steel beams were salvaged from the former House of Fraser on Oxford Street and have been reused within TBC. This pioneering scheme has saved an estimated 48 tonnes of carbon dioxide when compared with using new steelwork.",
                "In total, around 20% of the total steel used in the project is repurposed. The remaining steel framing at TBC.London contains at least 56% recycled content"
