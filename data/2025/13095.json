                "Built in 1887 by Sir Henry Tate for workers at his sugar factory on the other side of the road, the Institute has been a cornerstone of the Silvertown community ever since. What began as a social hub and communal baths for factory workers in the early 1900’s, later served as a public library and hall during the mid-20th century, and eventually evolved into a pool hall, bar, and performance space before closing in the early 2000’s. Loved by the people of Silvertown for generations, the building holds a rich and personal legacy for local residents that they have shared through recorded stories and donated memorabilia."

The renovated space will include an events hall, creative studios, kitchen, bar, and gardens for the community, with future plans to include an enterprise hub and residency space with recording studio. Once complete, the building will be operated by ReSpace, a non-profit organisation committed to delivering social value. ReSpace originally squatted the building in 2016 and opened up the building as The Craftory for local people. Now invited back by Newham Council, ReSpace have spent the six months prior to construction starting, delivering programming while the design and planning process has been ongoing."

This includes mining the existing building, where the timber ground floor structure has been used to repair rotten sections of the roof, through to the use of materials which would otherwise go to waste to form the new workshop spaces. Everything from the lights to the kitchen sink have been reclaimed in partnership with Re:New who have brokered material supplies."

For example, wood fibre insulation and lime plaster are used extensively around the masonry walls, roof and floor junctions to improve the thermal performance, airtightness, and breathability of the structure. The building’s net zero carbon operation will be achieved through solar panels and air source heat pumps, ensuring long term energy efficiency and operational affordability for community use."
