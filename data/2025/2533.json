                "St Mary’s is the only Grade I listed church in Wandsworth, with a rich history dating back to circa 800 AD. The current Georgian building, completed in 1777, was designed by local architect and churchwarden Joseph Dixon. This riverside site has inspired many artists, including Turner and Blake, who are both commemorated in the church’s stained glass windows.",
                "*Notable features include:",
                "*A mid-17th century East Window with rare secular painted glass",
                "*The original 1611 King James 'He' Bible",
                "*A towering Georgian double-decker pulpit",
                "*Monuments to Viscount Bolingbroke, Sir Edward Wynter, and more",
                "*John Napper's modern home-spun triptych in the side chapel depicts the Annunciation against the background of Battersea Park and the Power Station, Christ walking on the waters of the River Thames and Lazarus rising from the grave beneath the church's pedimented porch.",
                "*Four modern stained glass windows designed by John Hayward between 1976 and 1982 that celebrate:  JMW Turner (1775-1851) Artist - who painted from the church's river fronting oriel window. The chair in which he sat is located in the sanctuary. William Blake (1757-1827) Poet, Artist and writer of well-known hymn 'Jerusalem', was married here in 1872. Benedict Arnold (1741-1801) 'sometime general in the army of George Washington' who is buried in the crypt. William Curtis (1746-1799) botanist, member of the RHS and Linnaean Society and Praefectus Horti at the Society of Apothecaries (now Chelsea Physic Garden) is buried in the Churchyard.",
                "*St Mary's is the only Church in London that has a Thames-side graveyard and gardens. Battersea has changed hugely since the present Church was completed in 1777, but its churchyard is still very much a riverside oasis where visitors can pause and ponder, enjoy a tasty treat from Little Lou's coffee trailer and soak up the peaceful atmosphere of the riverfront.",
                "*Today St Mary's comprises a vibrant and active Anglican community. It has a strong musical tradition with a regular Choir as well as Choral Scholars (singers & organ) performing at Sunday services, Choral Evensongs and St Mary’s Music Recital Series held in the winter and the summer."
