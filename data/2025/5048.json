                "De Morgan House is formed from two of the nine terrace houses (Nos. 57 and 58), which run along the south side of the square (near the corner with Southampton Row).",
                "This symmetrical terrace was built c.1800-1803 by James Burton (who also built the nearby Foundling Hospital), having been commissioned by the 5th Duke of Bedford. In the mid 19th Century, the continuous cast-iron railings were added and in c.1898 the then Duke of Bedford commissioned the architect PE Pilditch to add the terracotta dressings following the building of Russell Hotel by Charles Fitzroy Doll. In 1969, all the buildings along this terrace were listed Grade II by English Heritage. The estate is now managed by Bedford Estates.",
                "Originally built as terrace houses for the upper and middle classes, the interior of these buildings was subsequently converted to offices though they retained features such as the staircases, ornamental fireplaces and high ceilings. The London Mathematical Society moved here in 1998 from Burlington House in Piccadilly to house its offices and renamed the building De Morgan House after the Society’s first president, Augustus De Morgan."

Both are four storeys in height and have a basement level though only No. 57 has a further attic level. There is also a garden space at the back of No. 57. The garden space behind No. 58 has since been built on to provide a further meeting room.",
                "Inside the buildings have been linked, losing some of the original layout. However, the staircases are still intact and each room still retains the high ceilings and ornamental fireplaces."
