                "In 1851 the Royal Gardens at Kew were transferred from the Crown to the State. William Hooker had been appointed Director in 1841 at a time when there was no official herbarium. Before then, Sir Joseph Banks’ herbarium and library in Soho Square had been used for queries on plant names and classification. Hooker made his own collection, perhaps the largest in private hands, available to staff and visitors. The ground floor of Hunter House became available to the Director in 1852, initially on a temporary basis, and was used to house Hooker’s herbarium, and the herbarium and library of Dr William Arnold Bromfield. The first Curator, Allan Black, was appointed in 1853.",
                "In 1876 the Drawing Room, South Room, kitchen and formal steps on the river frontage of Hunter House were demolished to make way for: First purpose-built wing of Herbarium (1877) – currently Wing C. It’s purpose-built storage for pressed, dried plant specimens over three floors, the upper two galleried on iron columns, with working bays maximising natural light as artificial (gas) light a serious fire hazard. Plant collections are mounted on paper and housed in wooden cabinets. Originally with elaborate ironwork and wooden panelling, in 1903 the wing was stripped, fire-proof concrete floors laid, and the galleries widened by 18 inches. The ironwork was probably simplified at this point.",
                "Second wing of Herbarium (1902) – currently Wing B. Galleried wing similar to Wing C. Originally with two spiral staircases, the second removed on addition of 3rd wing. Electric light installed throughout in 1904.",
                "Third wing of Herbarium (1932) – currently Wing A. Art Deco-style galleried wing over four floors designed by Ministry of Works architect, JH Markham.",
