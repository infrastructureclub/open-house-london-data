                "Part of a fine Victorian square in South London, an existing Grade II listed 1850 house has been sensitively renovated and extended by Dominic McKenzie Architects (DMA).",
                "Inspired by the arched windows and openings in the historic house, DMA’s design balances contemporary playfulness with sensitivity to the listed building and context.",
                "Responding to the surroundings of dark weathered brickwork, DMA’s extension fits sympathetically – a largely solid form read as part of a composition with the house’s original outrigger to the left.",
                "To subtly differentiate the extension from the existing house, it is constructed from bespoke bricks featuring a  graphic arch or segment motif. The bricks are arranged in a Flemish bond pattern matching the main house wall and pointed with lime mortar.",
                "For the interior, the clients had expressed their love of Scandinavian Modernism, particularly its use of timber panelling - DMA paid close attention to Gunnar Asplund’s 1936 Gothenburg City Hall.",
                "Segmental House's panelling is made of Douglas fir plywood arranged in two bands: a solid upper panel and a slatted dado layer.",
                "Secret doors conceal a hidden pantry and a TV cupboard . A special arched opening at skirting level allows the owners’ cats to access their hidden food bowls, an echo of the primary arched glazing in the rear extension.",
                "Generally a lighter touch was employed for the upper floors, respecting and restoring the existing historic detail of the listed house. At upper ground floor a new opening was created between the front and rear rooms – matching the detail of an existing arched recess found on an adjacent wall."
