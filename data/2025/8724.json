It was rebuilt, incorporating the existing remains and essentially to the same design as the old church, under the direction of Sir George Gilbert Scott, and was re-consecrated in 1870. There is a brass plaque just inside the entrance which lists the vicars through the years, the earliest being Elfsie in 960 AD."

Jasper Latham, the sculptor who worked with Christopher Wren on rebuilding St Paul's cathedral designed and created the Sheldon tomb.\n \nTwo memorials reveal Croydon's link with the American War of Independence.
