                "The National Army Museum started life in a converted riding school building at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. Founded by Royal Charter in 1960, it soon outgrew its original home, and role as a teaching resource for the young officer cadets, and became a place of remembrance for veterans and home to their memories and army 'souvenirs'. Field Marshal Sir Gerald Templer, former Chief of the Imperial General Staff, took up the task of finding a new home for the Museum, and picked the bombed site of the Royal Hospital Chelsea's infirmary.\nCome and find out more about the Museum displays at Sandhurst during the 1950s and 1960s, see photographs of the construction, and learn about how the Museum has developed during its 65 year history.\nThe National Army Museum is now part of the Chelsea Heritage Quarter - check out what the other CHQ partners, Royal Hospital Chelsea and Chelsea Physic Garden, have to offer for Open House. As well as the Archive Show and Tell talks, Open House visitors are welcome to drop in to the museum galleries and special exhibitions on Myth and Reality: Military Art in the Age of Queen Victoria and Beyond Burma: Forgotten Armies.  All are free to visit throughout the festival."
