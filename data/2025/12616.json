This Square Mile grew wealthy off the back of Britain becoming a maritime power. It turned away from the churches, and huge profits came from trading goods and people. Banks and insurance giants were created with a legacy that remains today. With its riches, it built prestigious buildings, symbolising architectural grandeur."
