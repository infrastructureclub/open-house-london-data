We meet by the River Thames and will follow the money and the architecture to uncover where it all began. This is where the companies that started the empire were based, with banking and insurance giants that still exist today. There aren’t any plaques to guide the way, but the Square Mile tells its own story.",

                "LONDON is one of the most popular cities on the planet yet in the UK, it’s a national hobby to dislike it. Many who live outside it wouldn’t drive 50 miles to see it. They say “you can keep London”. They say it’s full of pollution, politics and expensive pints. To the office worker there’s another story: London means a long commute, crowded trains and the 9-to-5. The greatest virtue to them is that they can get in and out quickly. Even to Londoners, the city is a mystery. It comes with a history which many don’t like - but others don’t know. How is it that so little is known about a city so big?",
                "London is lost and needs to be rediscovered. London started as a Roman city, becoming a royal city, a cathedral city, a capital city and more recently an Olympic city. But it’s also an empire city and that history is hiding in plain sight."

As you step into the City of London, there’s no museum or gallery to tell the story, yet its legacy is all around. Natalie created this tour to make that hidden history visible, connecting the dots between the streets, buildings, and institutions that shaped the Empire that still influence the world today."
