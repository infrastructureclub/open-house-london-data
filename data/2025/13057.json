                "Space Group proudly present “Gorgeous Georgian”, a full refurbishment and extension of a Grade II listed, five-storey Georgian residence in the All Saints Church Conservation Area in East London. This picturesque setting, close to a charming historic church, creates a serene backdrop for a home which has undergone a spectacular transformation. Designed to house our clients’ extensive art collection, the home now boasts four spacious bedrooms, three generous bathrooms, two traditional living rooms and an extraordinary kitchen/dining area.",
                "The spectacular rear extension, spanning the lower ground and ground floor, is finished in London stock brick to match the original structure. Inside, the double-height space showcases a listed cast iron spiral staircase, ensuring a direct connection between the lower ground floor and the garden. The interior also features a new travertine-clad staircase, rising through a glass box that floods the home with natural light and offers breathtaking views of Canary Wharf—a contemporary solution to head-height challenges. The reconfiguration artfully integrates the property’s difficult levels, with seamless access to the garden from both levels in the extension.",
                "Travertine is a defining element throughout, with varying finishes used in the kitchen, bathrooms, and staircase. The kitchen itself is a centrepiece of the design, anchored by three sculptural monoliths and enhanced by the stone's warm tones.",
                "State of the art comforts have been introduced to upgrade the house, including an energy-efficient infrared heating system, battery storage, and a luxurious steam room on the top floor.",
                "Despite these modern enhancements, the house has been restored to its former Georgian glory, preserving intricate architectural details while improving its functionality for contemporary living. Traditional sash windows have been carefully repaired and complemented with new conservation skylights on the mansard roof.",
                "The result is a remarkable residence that celebrates its architectural heritage while meeting the demands of modern living."
