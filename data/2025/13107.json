Currently under construction and due for completion in late 2025, the house has been designed by MAAPS as a sustainable replacement dwelling, tailored to the constraints of its floodplain context.",
                "Visitors will be able to explore the part-completed house and learn about the project’s architectural response to increasing flood risk and shifting climate conditions—balancing elevation and openness, resilience and light. The design draws inspiration from the elegant clarity of modernist forms and the relaxed informality of a riverside pavilion, combining robust flood-mitigation measures with generous terraces, renewable energy systems, and biophilic connections to the river landscape.",
                "Clothing and Footwear Requirement\nThis is a live building site and 70% complete at the time of the Open House event. Visitors are required to wear sturdy closed-toe shoes. Hard hats and hi-vis vests will be provided on entry.",
                "The Open House event includes a small exhibition of illustrated A1 panels and a series of informal 15-minute presentations given throughout the day. These will outline the development journey—from planning approvals in a Flood Zone 3b location, to strategies for sustainable construction, energy performance, and long-term adaptability."
