                "Stolon Studioâ€™s approach to housing is one which creates opportunity for social interaction between residents to enhance a sense of community and belonging and contribute to well-being. Sociable housing offers collective rather than communal living, creating a set of spaces that naturally facilitate choice for families and individuals who can choose how and when they would like to interact.  Our designs carefully mediate private and public thresholds, allowing  residents to engage in communal activities such as dining, studying, relaxing, and playing together, but able to retreat to their own space when they need privacy.\nCome and see this latest small development, as it nears completion, nestled alongside the more conventional development at Meridian Water."
