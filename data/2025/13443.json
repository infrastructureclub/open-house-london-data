                "The house has been conceived as a series of interconnected double-height spaces with front and rear lightwells creating extended sightlines and visual connections between levels. At ground floor, a 3m living green wall forms the backdrop to the kitchen-dining area, with a discreet first-floor terrace ensuring access to outdoor space from every habitable room, whilst a large format picture window provides framed views onto Butterfield Green.",
                "When viewed from Butterfield Green, the dwelling sits elevated like a tree house over the boundary wall, with the blackened timber cladding providing a sympathetic backdrop to the mature trees. Internally, oak is used throughout for floor finishes, stairs and carpentry items, complimented by a reduced palette of harder materials, including galvanised steel and polished concrete."

                "Greenview House and the adjoining property, Butterfied House, were constructed at the same. Although each dwelling is unique in its design (footprint, massing and envelope), both houses have utilised CLT to form the above ground structures. Building in this way minimised disruption and reduced build-times with both superstructres errected in less than five days.",
                "While the CLT is not exposed as a visual or architectural feature, it contributes to a quieter, more thermally balanced environment, reducing both external noise and temperature fluctuations."
