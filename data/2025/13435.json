Originally built in 1868, 75 Wallis Road first served as a factory for the manufacture of Parkesine, an early manmade plastic that offered an alternative to ivory and tortoiseshell, since then, the building has had many lives, as the home of cabinet maker Bernard Parker; as the store for Lesney products, the manufacturer of Dinky Toys and as a communist book warehouse. HTA acquired the building in 2020, following a ten-year search for a new home. 75 Wallis Road commanded respectful treatment to safeguard its sense of place. HTA’s approach retained and highlighted the original large span timber trusses, supporting ironwork and local brick envelope."

                "Our design approach retained and celebrated the hugely varied brickwork structure and the large timber and ironwork roof trusses. The addition of mezzanine floors, staircases and rooflights helped connect the four separate buildings into one seamless, fully accessible, interconnected whole workspace with added drama of huge double height spaces. The spaces within offer the variety and flexibility essential for today’s needs, but with future adaptability in mind. A muted colour palette celebrates inspired by the existing building fabric and draws on precedents and history of the surrounding context. Recycled timber and cork add to the natural finishes and as well as the reuse of all joinery and furniture from our previous home in Aldgate, optimising circularity as part of our sustainability ambitions. The result is a bright, light-filled, and calm atmosphere for staff and visitors."
