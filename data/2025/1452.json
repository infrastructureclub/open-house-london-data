This abstract pattern has allowed the design team to build seven different types of windows out of only three different tiles.",

The central wedge or hub, remains largely exposed leaving the steelwork as an architectural feature.",
                "The atria have been systematically attached to the external façade in order not only to use them as ventilation spaces, but also to connect visually to the core of the building. The north atrium extends upwards from ground floor level to third floor, while the adjacent southern atrium sits above a lecture theatre and media centre and consequently begins at third floor level, extending upwards to the roof."
