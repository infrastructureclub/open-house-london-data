                "This spoken word performance grows out of the Shell as Threshold workshop at London Museum Studios, which explored the cultural and ecological significance of the oyster in London.\nPerformed by Eva Gerretsen, representing the Boats Bring Bonds collective, the piece reflects on ideas of “watery commons” and multispecies care. Through meditative listening, it invites us to consider new forms of exchange between ourselves and our watery kin – the oyster.\nThe performance is accompanied by Oyster Music, an original pre-recorded composition by artist Frances Glass. Inspired by hydro-phonic recording techniques, the work sonically inhabits the shifting landscapes of the oyster, interpreting found sounds and synthesis to reveal the inherent music of nature.\nFrances Glass is a London-based artist making Art-Pop that questions and reimagines the cultural past, present, and future. Traversing genres, Glass works with symbols of meaning, asking how we hold on to hope in times of instability and accelerating change."
