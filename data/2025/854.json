It is on the northern edge of the old King's Wood (part of the Great North Wood) and was originally a lodge, built between 1811 and 1814 by William Vizard, a high profile solicitor who became President of the Law Society.",

In 1919 it was bought by a shipping and food processing magnate, Sir William Vestey. In 1922 when he was made a lord, Sir William took the title Baron Vestey of Kingswood.",

In 1965 it became the property of the London Borough of Southwark and was used as a community facility, including a library."
