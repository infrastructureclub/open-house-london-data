                "Reinventing the alleyways around The Photographers’ Gallery as Soho Photography Quarter has transformed an area previously considered as a backwater of Oxford Street into a new pedestrian destination. The area was formerly avoided by pedestrians as delivery zones, waste collections, antisocial activities and a taxi rat run contributed to a hostile urban environment.",
                "The new scheme builds on the unique character and ‘edginess’ of its small streets which lie in a transition area between Oxford Street and Soho. It celebrates how the distinct urban character of blank facades and inactive frontages can work in symbiosis with the introduction of a new cultural offer.\nWith The Photographers’ Gallery as the quarter’s focal point, these urban qualities have been utilised to unlock the area’s potential as a vibrant cultural quarter.",
                "The re-interpretation as pedestrian priority space sees kerb upstands eliminated and invites pedestrians to use the whole width of the street. New traffic regulations and cutting the rat run has considerably reduced vehicular traffic. Strategically positioned street furniture provides pedestrian refuge and changes the perception of priority for drivers.",
                "Porphyry sett paving has been introduced to all parts of the scheme. This sustainable, natural material provides the base matrix, relates to the colours of the existing brick facades, gives a calm background to the art programme and can withstand the pressures of the site.",
                "The introduction of new seating, tree and shrub planting throughout the area has increased dwell time as these elements offer opportunities to enjoy the art and atmosphere and retreat from the busy surroundings. A wayfinding scheme for the access points and a balanced, layered lighting scheme creates a safe and engaging ambience at night and elevates the attraction.",
                "The redefinition of the area as an art/photography quarter is realised by the creation of a rolling public art programme curated by TPG. A 45m long ‘Art Frieze’ which can be fitted with images of varying formats, large across the street banners, video projections and soundscapes provide a permanently installed but flexible infrastructure for changing artists. The adjustable lighting, hidden speakers and a video projector behind a new window, all add to make this urban space into a state-of -the-art public exhibition. Changes to the ground floor of TPG enhance its connectivity to the streetscape.",
                "The inclusion of public art attracts people to the area and the gallery, breaks down perceived barriers of art institutions and adds to the urban variety of the Oxford Street district, hence making the wider area more resilient as its retail focus is enriched with a novel cultural offer.",
                "Removing traffic from Hills Place introduces a new accessible alternative to the steps on Ramillies Street. By creating an attractive walking route and a welcoming public space, SPQ has established a new ‘Gateway to Soho’, connecting Oxford Street to Great Marlborough Street and Soho."
