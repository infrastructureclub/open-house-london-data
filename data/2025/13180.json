                "Acquiring a disused brownfield garage plot, Nelson Wright were able to successfully gain planning permission to create a continuation of the 2 storey Victorian terrace on a tree-lined street in Leytonstone, London. The design is conceived as a contemporary interpretation of the existing terrace, with familiar forms meeting minimalist detailing. Slender format Belgian bricks and tectonic cast stone elements help to create a blend of the traditional and modern. The project was self-developed by Nelson Wright, allowing them to be their own clients."

                "Nelson Wright designed and developed the project for the two directors who were seeking an alternative housing model after becoming disillusioned with the options available to first-time buyers in London. Following a rigorous search of backland and forgotten sites dotted around London on bicycles, they came across the brownfield garage plot at a property auction. They were able to arrange enough short term borrowing to buy the site, which allowed them to re-work the existing planning permission and add a second house to the plot. This uplift helped to finance the project and deliver more much needed housing on the disused plot."

Pocket doors allow privacy and enclosure to be controlled flexibly and a triple-height open stair connects the levels of the house together. A soft palette of materials combined with the contemporary exposed joists create a characterful quality. Sliding, folding glass doors frame views out to the walled garden, creating seamless indoor/outdoor spaces."
