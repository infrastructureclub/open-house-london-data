The Loop helps circular businesses scale their operations by connecting like-minded peers, helping trial new processes and undertaking R&D activities locally.\nVisitors will have access to the warehouse building that is not usually accessible to the public day-to-day. They can connect and visit the studios of some of London’s leaders in the circular economy, learn about the unique community ownership model behind the project, plus engage in an exhibition and workshops. The building will be open 5 to 9pm Thursday 18 September 2025.",
                "In addition, we will also be hosting workshops related to the Loop`s focus on circularity and sustainability. The workshops will teach how the circular economy relate to our everyday lives and learn about different practices that make up the circular economy. Alongside this, visitors can visit Growing Concerns who are trading in the yard at The Loop. This much-loved East London garden centre has found a new life at The Loop and allows local people to access a wide range of interesting and unusual plants, which change season to season."
