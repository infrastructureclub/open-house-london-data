                "By collapsing the roles of architect & developer, the project is a meticulously crafted new-built house, nestled in the heart of North London. What was once a neglected garden infill plot has been transformed into a stunning 2.5-storey sanctuary. We are keen to create space that heals, that brings space therapy, the art of creating and finding tranquillity in space. The interior palette has been meticulously curated; some of the furniture and paintings have been designed by Joan and made by Xia",
                "The living and dining space, strategically oriented to the south, invites an abundance of natural light through its skylit-pitched roof, creating an inviting indoor sunroom atmosphere. Meanwhile, the bedrooms and utility rooms are thoughtfully positioned to the north, ensuring optimal comfort and functionality.\nIn response to the evolving needs of modern living, especially particularly post-pandemic, the project challenges conventional spatial dynamics. A two-storey wooden structure with a pitched roof redefines the interplay between ground and upper levels, resulting in a sense of spaciousness, and airy ambience that celebrate the element of light. With a constraint site, with only window aperture to the north & south; together architect’s couple need for more light, which is the reason for creating the slatted floor.",
                "This space acts as the sunroom allowing light to travel to the centre of the house through skylight & windows; and addressing a usual cottage's dark, stuffy ground floor with deep plans. The light filters, and cascades onto the walls throughout the day. Many times you can guess what the time is looking at where the direction of shadows is casting. We believe a good space can reconfigure lighting and shadow in space. Light and shadows become a painting, sculpture, or an unintentional art installation…",
                "The master bathroom is crafted with timeless limestone and warm oak timber, they resemble and embody the rich history of bathing—a tradition spanning millennia, from sacred ceremonies to modern wellness sanctuaries. Evolving from a communal necessity to a symbol of individual indulgence, it now serves as a private retreat for one’s rejuvenation and contemplation.",
                "But beyond aesthetics, this home is a labour of love—from conception to completion, the architects have poured their hearts and souls into every detail, ensuring that each corner exudes warmth and authenticity."
