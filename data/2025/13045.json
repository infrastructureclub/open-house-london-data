The house has also been made entirely fossil-fuel-free. It is fitted with an air source heat pump, solar panels and whole house mechanical ventilation with heat recovery system.",

                "We reshuffled the old layout turning the previous kitchen, which faced the busy road into a new home for the technologies powering the house’s heating and hot water. The new kitchen extension is now located at the pivotal point connecting the house to the rear garden and leading to the garden studio.",
                "The materials were chosen for their sustainable credentials and high quality. The rich palette of mid-century colours is set against the restored parquet, new Barbican-like tiled floors and plywood furniture.",
                "Fabric-first approach of retrofitting meant that the cavity walls were filled with blown insulation and further upgraded with internal insulation. New mechanical ventilation with heat recovery was installed and an air source heat pump coupled with PV and solar-thermal panels provides heat and hot water for the property."
