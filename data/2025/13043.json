The building was downscaled to Number 17-18 Charlotte Road in 1931 and the basement and first floor of Number 19-22 became a cardboard factory until 1969. The building's refurbishment was featured in the July 2001 issue of Architectural Digest, which celebrated the historic building's conversion into a center for arts and architecture in London. The furniture and bookshelves in the library were fashioned from ash trees harvested from the Highgrove Estate. The library holds a unique collection of architectural references and resources.",
