The refurbishment involves a series of additions that has given the practice the opportunity to add a greater range of amenity and social spaces as well as diversity in work settings. The expansion of the triangular shaped building has been done alongside sensitive repairs to create a significantly improved office environment that retains the distinct character of the original building."

As part of several additions to the building’s structure, a new entrance and meeting rooms above project out into the courtyard. These large, expansive windows are echoed on the other side of the courtyard, where new meeting rooms have been suspended above the existing walkway.",

The inclusion of booth seating in the Teams Hub creates space for private, focused work, and improves accessibility for neurodiversity, by creating further alternative working environments that individuals can choose to best suit their needs."
