                "A modernist masterpiece, award-winning and Grade I listed, it was designed by British architect Sir Denys Lasdun (1914 - 2001) and opened in 1964. It provoked strong reactions when it was first revealed.\n‘This was an elegant, gracious street and now they slap us in the face with this thing.’ – Neighbour of the RCP at Regent’s park \n‘Sausage factory – or architecture of international standing?’ – Press\nLasdun was chosen out of several architects, and challenged by the RCP to create a modern building that reflected the RCP’s future, while showcasing its past and matching its surroundings. Lasdun designed a modernist building drawing inspiration from the structure of the human body with classical elements, dramatic interiors and space to celebrate our ceremony and history. It is one of the few post-war buildings to be awarded Grade I listed status. In 1992 Lasdun was awarded the Royal Institute of British Architects’ Trustees Medal in recognition of his work at the RCP, considered to be ‘the best architecture of its time anywhere in the world’. \n‘You can go and see it, and the building, if it has anything to say, will have to speak for itself.’ – Sir Denys Lasdun"
