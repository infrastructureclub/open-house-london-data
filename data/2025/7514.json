                "Kensal House estate's modernist community rooms form a Grade II* listed community centre in London's North Kensington, just 10 minutes from Grenfell Tower, is home to SPID Theatre. The groundbreaking estate incorporated community facilities such as a crèche, canteen and workshops and it was also the country's first gas-powered housing development. Designed in 1937 by architect Maxwell Fry and social reformer Elizabeth Denby, this modernist gem offered an urban village for former slum dwellers, providing the prototype for buildings of social worth like Finsbury Park Health Centre. Kensal House was one of the first council estates to be built in London and helped to champion the birth of the Welfare State. Now that more than 100 London estates are currently earmarked for demolition, its role is more important than ever. The community rooms house SPID's living history projects, documenting the heritage of local estates such as Grenfell and Trellick. The space has been registered as a community asset because of the programme of free arts, heritage and community activities that SPID runs from their base."
