                "For the last 200 years, St Mary's Church in Somers Town has been an extraordinary site of social action, not least with the work of Fr Basil Jellicoe and the founding of the St Pancras House Improvement Society.  In 2024, failing repairs to the church masonry and unsustainable scaffolding costs threatened the church with closure and demolition. The community, alongside conservation organisations including Historic England, SAVE, the Georgian Group and the Victorian Society have been working together with the Diocese of London to change that outcome and restore the church as a spiritual space that can continue to serve the community of Somers Town in the twenty-first century.",
                "Alex Veal of ARTArchitects sets out the phased approach to saving St Mary's, starting with  the restoration of the West Front. All aspects of the building need to be restored and reimagined, from the roof to the floor and the spaces within."
