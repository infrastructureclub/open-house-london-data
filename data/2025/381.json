Lansdowne House (formerly Shelburne House), was\ndesigned by Robert Adam for the British Prime Minister at the time, the 3rd Earl of Bute. Construction started in 1762 and it was sold unfinished 3 years later to William Petty Fitzmaurice, 2nd Earl of Shelburne and 1st Marquess of Lansdowne, who served as the British Prime Minister (1782–1783). The Treaty of Paris (1783), ending the American War of Independence was drafted in its Bow Room (now The Round Room Bar), and in 1904, the Entente Cordiale between Great Britain and France was signed here by Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne. In 1774, scientist Joseph Priestley was under the patronage of Lord Shelburne when he discovered oxygen at his laboratory in Calne. The implications of this discovery were not fully understood by him until a few\nmonths later, upon his return to his laboratory at Shelburne House."
