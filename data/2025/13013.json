                "The Fables Creative warehouse finds itself in the middle of a tucked away Norwood Junction industrial yard, a hub for metalworkers and mechanics. The building itself; formerly an ambulance Depot in the 1950s is a spacious brick construction with the high ceilings necessary for the large scale works of the Fables team. Shortly after moving in the Fables began internal renovations creating a mezzanine floor, internal offices and storage rooms clad in minimalist aesthetic from up-cycled birch panelling left over from a previous advert install. The workshop has been a continously growing space, now featuring a spraying room for paint and lacquer, CNC facilities and  a clean burning wood furnace supplied by EU green grant funding (believe it or not this way of dealing with wood waste is far more carbon efficient than sending to landfill). It is a space that looks different every day due to the wildly varied projects that are taken on daily by Fables."
