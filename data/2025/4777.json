                "The Burton Mausoleum is a unique example of Victorian funerary architecture. It is modelled on the tents used by Bedouin peoples in the Syrian desert and reflects the time spent in Syria by Sir Richard Francis Burton and Lady Isabel Burton. When Richard was unwell, he stated that when he died, “I should like us both to lie in a tent side by side”. The Forest of Dean sandstone is carved to resemble draping canvas and rope, and the pelmet is adorned with gilt stars and crescents. It is a fascinating building that incorporates both Catholic and Islamic symbolism and shows the cross-cultural influences that were present in the Burtons’ lives. Inside is an impressive collection of 19th century objects including jewelled lamps, camel bells, a statue of the Virgin Mary, and flowers from Sir Richard’s funeral. As per her instructions, Lady Isabel’s coffin was laid to rest beside her husband in 1896 and the door’s marble book updated to read: “Isabel, His Wife”."

The project, Burton: Exploring Without Boundaries is funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund. In September, Cliveden Conservation are working on the exterior and interior of the mausoleum, cleaning, repairing and stabilising the structure of the mausoleum. This means the Burton Mausoleum will look a bit different at this year’s Open House Festival. Scaffolding will be up around the mausoleum and so the window will not be accessible to look through and you will not be able to walk all the way around for your own safety.

                "Sir Richard Francis Burton (1821-1890) was a renowned Victorian explorer and linguist. He travelled widely while serving in the East India Company’s army and within the British Foreign Office. He served as Consul in several cities across the world including Damascus. This position was a goal of Richard’s, and he and Isabel spent happy years there experiencing life in Syria and travelling through the desert. He had long been fascinated by Islamic culture during his time in India and mastered Arabic and Hindī. He also became proficient in Marāṭhī, Sindhī, Punjābī, Telugu, Pashto, and Multānī. He translated Arabic works such as The Perfumed Garden and the only full edition of 1001 Arabian Nights. In 1853, Burton controversially disguised himself as an Afghan Sheik and performed the Hajj, the sacred pilgrimage to Mecca. He became the most famous non-Muslim to do so and his subsequent book Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Mecca (1855–56) serves as a rare record of 19th century Islamic culture. Today, Richard is best known for his expedition to the source of the Nile with John Hanning Speke in the 1850s. Relying on the knowledge and expertise of indigenous Africans guides, Burton and Speke travelled to the shores of the African great lakes."

                "Lady Isabel Burton (née Arundell) (1831-1896) was a well-travelled, confident woman who published several works of non-fiction and assisted her husband in editing some of his works. As a girl she believed she was destined for a life of adventure and international travel. Her memoirs are a striking insight into the internal world of an adventurous and confident young woman. Like Richard, she was fascinated with middle eastern and nomadic cultures, and was instrumental in gaining him the consulate at Damascus. Isabel travelled to many of the same places as Richard, joining him on extended expeditions in Brazil, India, Syria, Tenerife and Madeira, and throughout Europe. Isabel is often overlooked, or even criticised, in stories about her husband. She is most known for destroying many of Richard’s papers following his death."
