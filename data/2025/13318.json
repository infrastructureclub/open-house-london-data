They believe in the quiet power of making - in clay’s ability to connect us with ourselves, each other and the world around us. Since 2007, Clayground Collective has worked across the UK and internationally to bring clay out of the studio and into public spaces - from libraries and galleries to canal boats and town squares - inviting communities of all ages to get creative and rediscover the joy of working with their hands.",
                "Their projects combine playfulness with purpose as joyful assemblies, using clay’s universal appeal to engage diverse audiences and spark dialogue about the value of craft in contemporary life. Over 200,000 people have taken part in Clayground Collective’s workshops, public artworks and large-scale installations, which often leave lasting memories and skills.",
                "As authors of Clay in Common (Triarchy Press), the first major book on participatory clay practice, Clayground are recognised as leaders in their field, with awards including the Craft Skills Award for “imaginative and exemplary approaches to passing on clay skills.”"
