Following Young’s closure in 2006, a small-scale brewery was maintained on site during the construction period to ensure that the development retained its historic legacy. The original Grade II* listed brewery complex is now home to a new brewery, a Heritage Centre, premises occupied by other independent retailers (e.g. a restaurant and southwest London's only bowling alley), and exclusive loft-style residential apartments."

                "Ten lower-level buildings adopt and reinterpret the materials, forms and scale of the existing industrial structures to define the urban edges of the public realm. At ground level, the elevations are enlivened with retail units to create a vibrant and active environment, whilst above, the high-quality residential accommodation benefits from the more tranquil setting of private roof gardens."

The development's Heritage Centre contains many fascinating artefacts from the site's history.  The site also houses a pair of magnificent early Victorian beam engines, the oldest of their type anywhere in the world still in their original location and never having been out of working condition.  Each Open House tour will conclude with a free visit to the Heritage Centre for the first fifteen people who register."
