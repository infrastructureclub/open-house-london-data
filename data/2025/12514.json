But first, he had to deconstruct a huge Victorian church, and bring it by himself to its new site.\r\nHowever, St Mark's is Grade 2 listed, not because of its origin, but due to its style.",

However, it had become disused before WW2. Having gained permission from church authorities, Rev Vivian Symons brought to Biggin Hill 125,000 bricks, 200 tons of stonework and all the timbers of the original building for the construction of a new church in Biggin Hill.",
                "The design of St Mark's was to be completely different. The Moving Church has a unique form: a modernist building designed by George Gilbert Scott & Partners (a first commission for Richard Gilbert Scott). The external perpendicular style with tall stone window mullions masks the delightful internal barrel-vaulted roof structure and is a wonderful example of the architectâ€™s style. When you enter the building, the effect is amazing."
