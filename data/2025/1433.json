                "Originally planned as a hospital for retired seamen by Sir Christopher Wren the campus of the University of Greenwich is based on three spectacular Grade I baroque buildings; Queen Anne Court, Queen Mary Court and King William Court.",
                "In the 17th century Queen Mary decided that a naval hospital, one similar to the Chelsea Hospital for wounded soldiers, was required. Sir Christopher Wren, amongst other architects, was commissioned for the project. He chiefly used John Webbâ€™s design for the King Charles block, which had already begun construction with the idea of forming a palace for King Charles II before funds were diverted. It was boarded up and left until the site was granted for use as the Royal Naval Hospital in 1694. The complex has become famous for being one of the best examples of baroque architecture in Britain.",
                "Queen Mary's Court was the last of the four Royal Naval Hospital buildings to be completed, following Christopher Wren's layout, but designed and built by Thomas Ripley.",
                "The university has retained the historic layout throughout. The cabin walls have been stripped back to reveal original original timber panelling, barrel vaulting and Portland stone."
