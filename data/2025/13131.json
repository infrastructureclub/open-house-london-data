                "This tour will start from the Grade I-listed Georgian-style Marble Hill house built by and for an influential woman in the 1720s, and finish at Richmond Terrace built in the 18th century with the English landscape view protected by an Act of the Parliament in 1902 and painted by Turner and Reynolds.",
                "We will examine the development of three distinct residential areas on the side of East Twickenham by speculative developers.  Victorian style houses and Mansion blocks developed in 1899 south of Richmond road, mid century style two story semi detached houses developed in the 1930s (now a conservation area) north of Richmond road. We will look at the Richmond Riverside development by Quinlan Terry architects in 1980s, and examine how historical buildings were preserved in the development in creating harmony.",
                "We will look at the impact of the development of transportation link on the suburban development, from the building of Richmond Bridge in 1777 to the building of Richmond Station in 1864 and tube link in 1877.",
                "Along the way, we will stop at the Poppy Factory which still makes poppies at this factory in Richmond until this day.  We will look at the 1930 Art Deco-style factory and a 1970s Brutalist-style brick block which have been sympathetically retrofitted by Henly Halebrown in 2019."
