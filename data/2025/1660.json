The original house was torn down and rebuilt to Soane’s design in order to extend his Museum even further, creating his celebrated Picture Room at the back of the house whilst the front was rented out. Although the front of the house passed into private hands after Soane's death, this beautiful building was fully incorporated into Sir John Soane’s Museum in 1996. Today, it serves many important purposes, including housing our Library and Adam Study Centre, as well as being another stunning example of the architect’s signature style."
