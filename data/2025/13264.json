                "St Matthew's is a little known church with a rich history. Opened in 1851 in what Charles Dickens referred to as 'the Devil's Acre', it was at the forefront of both the Anglo-Catholic revival in the Church of England, and that movement's outreach to the poorest urban communities in Victorian London. Since then, St Matthew's has been a diverse church where people from across historic class divides have worshipped together.",
                "The Victorian church was gutted by arson in the 1970s and reopened for worship in 1984. Thus today St Matthew's has unique architecture - the shell of Sir George Gilbert Scott's neo-Gothic church combined with modern design. Much of our furnishings are original, such as the grand reredos or the altar which contains a relic of St Matthew himself. Of particular interest is the original Lady Chapel which was designed by famed architect Sir Ninian Comper and which miraculously survived the fire. This houses what Comper claims was the first 'English style' altar since the Reformation, complete with 'riddel posts' at each corner.",
                "Today St Matthew's continues true to its original mission of being a church for all people, no matter their background. We are a diverse and genuinely welcoming community whose hallmarks are dialogue, hospitality, and worship. We are part of the Liberal Catholic tradition and a member of Inclusive Church. Our worship is characterised by the rich music tradition we foster here, supported by our historic Mander organ and our excellent choir."
