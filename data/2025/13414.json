Contrasting with this, there are contemporary photos showing the vibrant, diverse and lively borough as it is now.\nOn 1 April 1965, the Borough was created, under the London Government Act 1963, bringing together the combined areas of:\n• The Municipal Borough of Brentford and Chiswick;\n• The Municipal Borough of Heston and Isleworth; and\n• Feltham Urban District.\nThe area was transferred from Middlesex to Greater London to become one of the 32 London Boroughs.\nEach one of Hounslow's seven community forum areas is represented with four photos (from across the borough - Bedfont and Heston to Gunnersbury and Chiswick) . Compare the ‘then’ and the ‘now’, using location maps on the labels to navigate, and the text below each image to find out more.\nLearn more about the area's history with amazing buildings from the past or be inspired by contemporary architecture and urbanscapes.",
