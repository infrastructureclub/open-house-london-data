Since then, she and her small artisan team have been producing glassware for Gather and for a number of interior and lighting clients. \nThe studio runs on a large electric furnace – a commitment to reducing the use of fossil fuels. Gather also has two small electric furnaces for melting waste glass as well as a double ended reheating furnace, designed to make two workstations from one."
