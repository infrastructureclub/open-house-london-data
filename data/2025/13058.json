Our office at 493 Hackney Rd, once London’s oldest ironmongers, then a plant shop, was renovated to preserve character and serve as our long term base. We look forward to continuing the journey of opening our shop to new visitors and collaborators.",

                "Presland & Sons opened for business in 1797 and traded from the same location, over two hundred years later as The One Stop Metal Shop. Operating at first from a wooden shack built around 1760, they constructed their own purpose-built shop and factory at the beginning of the nineteenth century, which suited their needs so perfectly that – in an astonishing and rare survival – it stands almost unaltered today. A unique complex of buildings that carries two centuries of history of industry in the East End.",
                "Following this time the shop got over Conservatory Archives, established in 2015, it began as a small shop on Hackney Road, housing a curated assortment of intriguing plant specimens and antique furniture. As interest in our curious green characters grew, so did the number of plants within the space and soon the Hackney Road store became a miniature jungle, teeming with as many unique and diverse species as it could fit into every available corner.",
                "Visitors not only will learn about the space but are driven by in-depth research, investigating the context and meaning of sites, client aspirations, community need, and the ideas and motifs that will bring each project to life.",
