Founded in 1719, the church was rebuilt in 1909 by Eustace Balfour of Balfour and Turner. The current building is in red brick with Portland stone dressings, in a restrained and, as usual with Balfour, individual, finely crafted Free Style.  There are four fine stained glass windows, most by Farrar-Bell, which celebrate our Scottish heritage, women of the Bible, and our own twentieth century history.",
