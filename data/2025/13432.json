                "Space House is one of London’s most remarkable mid-century buildings, redeveloped and modernised to offer a workspace where ambitious businesses and exceptional people can think differently and thrive.",
                "Designed by Seifert & Partners during an era of significant change and progress in the sixties, Space House was listed as a Grade II building, having undergone a remarkable restoration and modernisation programme. The result is 255,000 sq. ft of lifestyle-led intelligent, adaptable, and characterful workplace campus that will help redefine our approach to modern ways of working.",
                "It demonstrates the power of thoughtful and environmentally responsible redevelopment in preserving and continuing to celebrate London’s rich culture and heritage. Heritage buildings can reveal workspaces filled with character and personality, reimagining old spaces as new places for creativity, learning, socialising, focused work, exercise, and rejuvenation, cultivating an authentic sense of community, typically beyond the reach of glass and steel boxes.",
                "Located on its own island site, its iconic circular tower rises seventeen storeys above its Covent Garden location, offering rarely seen 360-degree views of the city.",
                "Space House comprises 230,100 sq. ft of smart, adaptable net zero carbon workspaces, filled with character, personality, flooded by natural daylight and rarely seen 360° views of London. The workspaces are split between the tower and the block, providing four different workspace typologies.",
                "Space House offers 27,700 sq ft of lifestyle spaces - six new day through night lifestyle spaces (Public Piazza, Filing Station Restaurant, Lounge, Clubhouse + Terrace, Cycle Centre and a 16,000 sq ft underground events space) for the use of Space House occupiers. The management philosophy for the estate is focused on supporting and enriching the everyday experience; from seamless technology and a Space House app placing personal choice and support at your fingertips, to an always on concierge for a personal human connection when needed, and a carefully curated learning, wellness, social and cultural programme running every day.",
                "All this, located within the culturally rich and lively neighbourhood of Covent Garden in the heart of central London. Innovative and cultural communities include 180 Studios, Somerset House, the campuses of Kings College, LSE, London’s theatre district, the famous Covent Garden market to luxury restaurants and brands.",
                "Some big brands call this neighbourhood home – Paul Smith, Charlotte Tilbury, Spotify, Apollo, GSK, Peloton, Dazed, Google, Mishcon de Reya, Coutts, Bain & Company, pwc, McKinsey & Company and many more.",
                "Space House is a lifestyle choice, designed for people to get the most out of their days and thrive. And where people thrive, businesses thrive."
