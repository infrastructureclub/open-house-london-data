                "The idea of a ‘remarkable home’ is equally familiar and elusive. It’s a phrase loaded with personal ambition, design influences – and economic reality. In a panel debate hosted by Concrete Communities, Aucoot will lead a discussion on how we can unravel the dream and navigate the realities. We’ll examine the tangible side of renovation, such as balancing aspiration and budget, as well as considering the feel of a location and housing typologies.",
                "By looking at the spectrum people use to define ‘a remarkable home’, the panellists aim to share insight on decisions around colour, materiality and atmosphere. The conversation will consider strategic design questions that shape long-term value – in addition to managing shifting scope and the complexity of planning regulations. In a climate where domestic space carries more cultural and financial weight than ever before, decisions made during the renovation process have real consequences. Industry experts will share how we can combine compromise, craft and creativity to build a space we’re proud of."
