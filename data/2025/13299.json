This tour through 400 years of history will look at the ones we remember and how we  commemorate them – and the ones that have been lost and forgotten."

They were part of an energetic community of religious dissenters, many of whom were connected with the Unitarian church, which disagreed with Church of England doctrine and who were excluded from public life."

The booming population was accompanied by an upsurge in poverty, overcrowding and disease, and the larger area of Mildmay Park – so called after the Mildmay family, which owned land there from the 17th century – became identified with another community: the missionaries William and Catherine Pennefather, the deaconesses they trained and the charitable work they did in the area and in the East End, which has left the legacy of Mildmay Mission Hospital."

Another important Jewish site in the area, the burial ground in Kingsbury Road, is going to be restored after years of neglect.",
