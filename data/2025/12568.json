A large and beautifully-built Victorian Church tucked away among the trees.  There is a distinct sense of quiet tranquillity on entering through the large wooden doors.  The original  stained glass windows provide so much detail to study that you can gaze at each one for some time and keep seeing something new.  And the magnificent organ, in full working order, is a rarity today.  If you enjoy Victorian architecture and the beauty of church buildings, this is the place to visit."
