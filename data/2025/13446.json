                "Elevate (formerly known as the Legacy Youth Board) is a youth programme that has involved, connected and inspired over 3,000 young people in east London to the opportunities on Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Designed for young people, by young people, made up of a collective of young people who use their unique lived experience to drive innovation, shape change and elevate futures. \n \nThe Elevate Board is made up and led by a dedicated group of 18–25 year olds, unified by a shared home in the Park’s four neighbouring boroughs of Hackney, Newham, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest. Elevate represents diversity in age, as well as ethnicity, gender and lived experiences, to bring an alternative perspective to the boardrooms that make crucial decisions for the future of the areas that have defined us."
