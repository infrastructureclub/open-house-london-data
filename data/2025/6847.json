There were about 40,000 Jews in London, mostly living in the City of London and nearby in places like Islington. They were involved in business and trade, areas where they did not face restrictions as in the law and medicine. It was the beginning of an era of Emancipation for Jews.",

                "It literally charts the fortunes and development of the Jewish community in London. Its heyday spanned the Victorian and Edwardian eras, two world wars and the post-war suburban boom from the 1940s to the 1970s."

Funerary buildings, three tombs and the war memorial were listed Grade II in 2017 and the site added to the Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest.",
                "The 1873 central buildings complex is preserved almost completely in its original state, and the sheer architectural variety of memorials with their extensive epitaphs tell us much about the individuals and their community, making a very rich setting for historical research."

It aims to delve into the history of the interred and uncover more stories to build a collective memory of the place and its community.",

Willesden also has the graves of many ordinary local families and many stories we donâ€™t yet know, or which have been forgotten and are in danger of being lost forever."
