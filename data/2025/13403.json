While visiting the now buried Palm House, we will hear of the migration stories of the plants themselves - how their ancestors were captured from wilderness homes across the world and transported by ship to this infamous nursery in East London.",

The walk's route takes place through public gardens that feature as a “living museum”, with their array of flowers, shrubs and trees that were originally imported into the UK during the 1700 / 1800's. Stories about plants and their plant hunters, worldwide expeditions for plants during the colonial era, the role of exotic plant collecting will offer insight into the historical context that facilitated the creation of this large Nursery that specialised in tropical plants."
