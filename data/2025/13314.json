                "Sadler’s Wells East is a brand new theatre for dance that opened in February 2025 as part of East Bank in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, Stratford.\nSadler’s Wells is a world-leading dance organisation that makes and shares dance that inspires us, through a year-round programme of performances and experiences. Sadler’s Wells East is the organisation’s new fourth theatre which is home to everything from hip hop to ballet, rave to rhumba and kathak to krumping.\nThis new cultural venue features a theatre with 550 seats that can fold away to create a more flexible space. The foyer is home to The Dance Floor, a public performance space that hosts a range of free activities, and the Park Kitchen and Bar. The building also features six new dance studios that provide space to support artist development and the creation of new work.\nThe building’s distinctive design was created by architects O’Donnell and Tuomey, who have echoed the industrial factories that populated Stratford in the 18th century with the signature brick style and sawtooth roofline."
