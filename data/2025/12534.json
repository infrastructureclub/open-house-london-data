                "Part new-build, and part retrofit, the design weaves both elements through the existing concrete frame structure, preserving the building’s modular plan and its existing 60 studios, reconfiguring spaces to create an additional five spaces. The key architectural move is a dramatic 6m-wide opening-up of the 21m-long, 3.5m-high brick wall to the street, transforming what was previously an inaccessible, underused front yard into a new craft garden which serves as a welcoming gateway, housing a new public entrance, a new public art installation designed by Cockpit maker Amber Khokhar, flexible educational spaces, a café and a revamped leatherworkers’ hub. This gives Cockpit Deptford a permanent public presence for the first time, making it more open, active, inviting and accessible."
