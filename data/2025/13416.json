Originally part of an industrial warehouse, the building retains its raw, open-plan feel while blending in contemporary design touches — from its striking reclaimed wood features to large-scale art murals created by local and international artists.",
                "Since opening, Number 90 has become a cultural hub, bringing together food, art, and music under one roof. It’s home to an ever-changing exhibition of artwork, a seasonal menu that celebrates fresh and locally sourced produce, and a diverse programme of live music and DJ events, ranging from electronic and house music to jazz and soul.",
                "Hideout – An audiophile’s dream\nHideout room is a hidden gem within the venue, designed for immersive music experiences. It features a high-fidelity sound system and 360-degree projection mapping, creating a unique space where visuals and sound meet. It’s become a go-to for audiophiles, live AV performances, and intimate music showcases.",
                "Cultural Significance\nHackney Wick has a rich history as a creative district, with many of its former industrial spaces transformed into artist studios, music venues, and cultural spaces. Number 90 reflects this transformation — preserving the building’s industrial character while reimagining it as a place for community, creativity, and connection.",
