Bricks were produced locally and were used to build homes in the area. The farmers supplied the food  and milk in conjunction with the local market gardens.  A well known bell foundry was 3 minutes walk away. \nThe church was used  by the community during the second world war and continues to be used to this day for those who live and work nearby."
