Marshall Mackenzie and Son, selected through an architectural competition judged by leading artists including Bertram Mackennal, John Longstaff, George Lambert, Fred Leist and Arthur Streeton. The judges described the design as “a lasting monument to the importance of the Commonwealth and a splendid addition to the architecture of London.”",
                "The Commonwealth of Australia’s chief architect, J. S. Murdoch, travelled to London to collaborate with the Mackenzie firm. Construction began in 1913 under builders Dove Brothers of Islington, though work was delayed by the First World War. Despite these challenges, High Commissioner Andrew Fisher and his staff moved into temporary offices on the site in 1916 while work continued around them.",
                "On 24 July 1913 King George V, accompanied by Queen Mary and Princess Mary, laid the foundation stone. The ceremony ended with enthusiastic cries of “Coo-ee” from the predominantly Australian crowd, which The Daily Express described as “a long-drawn, plaintive cry … coming to Londoners’ ears with almost startling novelty.”",
                "King George V officially opened Australia House on 3 August 1918, joined by Australian Prime Minister W. M. Hughes, High Commissioner Andrew Fisher and Minister for the Navy Joseph Cook."

During both World Wars, it served as a home away from home for Australian troops and as a headquarters. In the Second World War, the Boomerang Club was formed within the building, offering troops a place to relax, catch up on news, meet friends and attend dances.",
                "From its opening until the 1970s, Australia House remained open to visitors and even served as a post‑restante for Australians collecting mail from home. Until the 1990s it functioned as a library, where Australians came to read newspapers from across the country. In the 1960s and 70s, adventurous travellers often gathered outside the building to buy or sell old Kombi vans for trips across the European continent.",
