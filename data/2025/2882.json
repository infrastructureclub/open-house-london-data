                "- Architectural interest: the design’s bold elevational treatment and skilful handling of pre-cast concrete components and their finishes confer a strong aesthetic while respecting the wider Victorian townscape.\n \n- The jewel-like, top-lit assembly hall is a particularly notable feature where the use of timber and concrete gives a rich texture.",

Acland Burghley favourably compares with the listed Lilian Baylis and Haggerston Schools, and is a good example of a school commissioned from well-regarded architects during this formative period."
