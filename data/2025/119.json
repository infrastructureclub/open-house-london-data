The building was purchased from British Airways on a 127 year lease at a cost of £11 million. Sir Bernard Weatherill, the Speaker of the House of Commons, officially opened the new NAO headquarters on 28 November 1986. The building, originally built by Imperial Airways, was opened to the public on 5 June 1939.",
                "On one side of the building coaches took passengers to Croydon airport for flights to the continent and at the back of the building passengers could step directly onto platform 17 (now platform 19) of Victoria Station to take the ‘Empire Special’ train to Southampton. From there they would take flying boat services to Egypt, Central and South Africa, India, the Far East and Australia. Marking the occasion of the first journey to Southampton, the stationmaster of Victoria appeared in a top hat, and a morning coat with a red carnation.",
                "On 1 April 1940 Imperial Airways was merged with British Airways and officially became British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC). Extensions to the building were added in the 50s and 60s, although by then the coaches were taking passengers to Heathrow.",
                "With improved access to Heathrow, including a direct link to the Piccadilly line in 1977, there was less need for a Terminal in the centre of the city and the building was put up for sale in the early 80s."
