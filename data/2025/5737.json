A crisp weathering steel volume of two corten shells is inserted behind the retained walls of a 19th century brick stables. The weathering steel shells will create a patina and colour responsive to the local vernacular, and are delicately perforated to cast dappled light in the interior spaces, reminiscent of light filtered through trees.",

The smaller wing, containing more private spaces and master bedroom, is clad fully in weathered steel and glass and is set back from the street. The two wings are connected by a transparent, glazed circulation link, which overlooks a secluded outdoor courtyard; a seamless and secure extension of the internal space.",

The house is designed such that mechanical cooling is not required. \n- Gross floor area: 375 sqm\n- Architects: Piercy & Company is an award winning architectural practice with a reputation for bold ideas, strong forms and carefully crafted buildings. Led by Stuart Piercy, the studio interprets vernacular architecture and traditional forms, preserving links to the past whilst addressing the conditions of contemporary cities and technologies.  \n- Structural Engineer: Tim Lucas, Price & Myers"
