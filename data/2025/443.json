                "Before 1926, the central offices of Quakers in Britain were located in Devonshire House on Bishopsgate in the City of London. Quakers in Britain had been renting rooms there since 1666, prior to which it had been the London home of the Dukes of Devonshire. Over time the Quakers obtained the lease of the building and adjoining ground and erected purpose-built meeting houses and offices. By 1911, the site was no longer of sufficient size for the number of employees that worked there and a committee was set up to consider rebuilding or moving",
                "After a spirited debate among Quakers, it was agreed to sell the Devonshire House site and look for new premises. They purchased the freehold of Endsleigh Gardens for £45,000 in 1923. The choice of Endsleigh Gardens was quite controversial, as it was a greenfield site, and the building of Friends House was criticised by The London Society."

                "After the new site had been purchased, five Quaker architects were invited to submit outline plans for the new facility. The specifications included a large meeting house capable of seating 1,500 people for the annual gathering of Quakers (Yearly Meeting), a smaller meeting house, office space and a library with strong rooms.",
                "The winning design was created by Hubert Lidbetter, who presented a simple and elegant neo-Georgian design of Portland stone and brick. It consisted of three distinct blocks, each with its own entrance. The eastern section, with the garden entrance, was designed for administration, the central block with the colonnaded entrance on Euston Road contained the large and small meeting spaces, and the west block, with its entrance on Gordon Street, was created for letting out. This western section is now known as Drayton House.",
                "The completed building won the RIBA Bronze medal in 1927 for the best building erected in London that year. It was described in the Architectural Review as \"eminently Quakerly … [it] unites common sense with just so much relief from absolute plainness as gives pleasure to the eye\". It was Grade II-listed in May 1996."

A 200-square-meter floor space and a skylight were created. In an echo of Hubert Lidbetter’s 1927 RIBA bronze medal, The Light won a RIBA Regional award in 2015. It continues to be the primary venue for Yearly Meeting."
