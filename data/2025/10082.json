                "Over the years the theatre has been home to a wide variety of performances, showcasing numerous puppetry forms including bunraku, object theatre and black box theatre. The Marionette bridges remain, and will hopefully play a crucial role in protecting Marionette making and performance in the future as they have been recently added to the list of endangered crafts.",
