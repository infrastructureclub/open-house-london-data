                "Located in a small industrial enclave surrounded by Queen's Woods, the new studio has spent the last 25 years as an indoor garden design workshop. It has recently been lovingly renovated by the former occupier, a life-long collector of British studio ceramics, and a personal friend of some of the leading ceramicists of the post-war generation.",
                "The building  goes back to the 1930s, and is brick built, with a north facing saw toothed roof that offers the perfect light quality for artists and makers. Its pillars have already been painted in a distinctive yellow orange, a playful touch that will be accentuated by a new style of colourful, mid century-inspired Turning Earth furniture design.",
                "Adjacent Highgate Woods is home to a recently discovered Roman kiln, and the practice of pottery in the area goes back to prehistory. In the studio's back yard is the makings of a dry garden, which Turning Earth will gradually develop into a contemplative space, decorated with stone built cairns in tribute to the ancient druidic history of pottery in the UK, as well as the rhododendrons and maples common to the magical Zen gardens of Japan, reflecting a spiritual culture which has had an important influence on the ceramics heritage of these islands since the early 20th Century.",
