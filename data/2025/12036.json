The first phase of the Island, Dane's Yard, completed in 2020 offering a collection of 8 distinctive buildings for office and commercial uses. Since then, two phases of residential and a further 220,000 sq ft of office and education space has complete. The development is now a third of the way through the build programme, with construction of the next two plots planned to start in 2026.

Two industrial era chimneys were carefully dismantled when construction began, taken away for cleaning and have now been rebuilt in their original footprint using the same bricks. Subtle nods to the site's history can be found throughout, from the materials and colour pallets of new buildings, to the naming of streets and yards. The industries that have operated here throughout history include textile and ink manufacture, a sugar refinery, soap making and a gin distillery."

Reuse, reduce, recycle has always been one of their mottos, and for that reason a lot of the decor, furniture and construction materials have been upcycled. \nJoin Jim & Tonic for tours of the gin distillery and guided tasting sessions, as well as music, fun and festivities throughout the day."
