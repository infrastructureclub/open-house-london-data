Each artwork relates to locations selected by residents and explores the local culture, ecology and heritage of the area, encompassing a broad range of mediums including, two colourful interactive kaleidoscope and teleidoscope sculptures; wall-based installations; a ceramic bookshelf; a large photographic portrait of the community; a hand-painted mural; an AI interactive installation enabling visitors to speak to the Story Tree; a rotating LED sculpture, ground-based cast metal Woman Whole covers, and a series of 13 alternative street name signs."
