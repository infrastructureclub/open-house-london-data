                "Join us for a guided tour of the Story Trail artworks and hear about the stories and inspiration behind each of them. Each artwork relates to locations selected by residents and explores the local culture, ecology and heritage of the area, encompassing a broad range of mediums including, two colourful interactive kaleidoscope and teleidoscope sculptures; wall-based installations; a ceramic bookshelf; a large photographic portrait of the community; a hand-painted mural; an AI interactive installation enabling visitors to speak to the Story Tree; a rotating LED sculpture, ground-based cast metal Woman Whole covers, and a series of 13 alternative street name signs."
