                "The development is a 10 year meanwhile use required to facilitate the construction of HS2 Euston Station and to re-provide the Construction Skills Centre which was previously granted consent on the application site.\nThe addition of the building provides a high-quality environment for users of both the Site Accommodation and Construction Skills Centre and will provide positive branding for the ‘front door’ of the HS2 Euston Station construction site.\nThe ground floor of the building is solely given over to the Construction Skills Centre with access through a new public park. Access to the site accommodation is provided on the north side and via the main HS2 site. Construction of the ground floor employs a traditional steel portal frame sitting on new innovative ground source Hyper Concrete Piles. A sustainable new hollow concrete pile employing ground source heat was developed for this project. The 5 storeys above ground level employ 216 12M long x3M wide x3M high off-site modular units providing offices, canteen, showers, changing and amenity for the 2,500 site operatives and staff delivering the HS2 main station works. \nThe development incorporates the Construction Skills Centre as an integrated yet separate function of the Site Accommodation, on the site of the former Maria Fidelis school. Combining the functions offers benefits to both the project and local community through linking training to employment requirements on site for local people, upskilling the construction workforce, potential shared space for briefings and inductions, educational visits and shared viewing areas.",
                "The project objectives are as follows:\n• Supporting the requirements of the local community and stakeholders, by including the Construction Skills Centre;\n• Protecting green space being delivered across the wider Maria Fidelis site by providing a meanwhile use public park and allotment space\n• Providing sustainable and re-usable solutions to reduce the carbon footprint of the project. At the end of the project all of the 216 modular units are to be recycled and reused by the manufacturer. \n• Promoting positive branding of the Euston Station Project and HS2 by acting as the ‘front door’ to the project;\n• Providing best lifecycle value for HS2; and\n• Delivering construction skills training for the local borough and providing immediate access to construction opportunities on the HS2 Phase One and beyond.",
                "The modular units have been adapted from the standard model to include a much greater level of thermal and acoustic insulation with the glazing to be as efficient as possible. Although this is a temporary building it was felt that it would need to meet and surpass current building regulation standards and provide a BREEAM rating of Very Good. The façade is formed of traditional metal rain screen cladding and long-life vinyl wrap. The design is aimed at echoing the traditional railway siding architecture of monumental warehouses and the goods yard.\nBiodiversity has been paramount to the design with the incorporation of green and brown roofs together with green walls and facades."
