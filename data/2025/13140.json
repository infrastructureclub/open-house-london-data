                "With its tree-lined streets and ample parks, Southgate appears the epitome of unchanging North London suburbia: a space of rest and relaxation far from the fast-paced energy of central London.",
                "This walk will aim to challenge this perception of stasis.  It will uncover what lies beneath the suburban streets and how shaped they are by the private estates on which they were built.  We will also examine the changing architecture of the area and uncover a mix of styles, including modernist masterpieces which were hailed in their day and are now markers for lost futures.",
                "We will also take a closer look at the area’s parks, show how their structure and use has altered over time and question how ‘natural’ such landscapes are. Exploring themes of 'city' and 'the country', this walk will use the example of Southgate to open up wider questions on how ideas on ‘health’ and ‘nature’ have developed over time."
