The core of the show will be paintings of museum objects, based on drawings made during his residency.\nNotions of authenticity lie at the heart of his artistic enquiry, as he looks for evidence of the real thing within his practice. Artists’ materials such as masking tape and paper are rendered in paint to appear as taped or pinned on a wooden surface, a practice that refers to a specific form of illusionism that proliferated in 17th century Northern Europe called quodlibet (what you will)."

It allows her to translate her observations visually onto paper so that others may interpret what she has seen. It is often exciting when someone notices something totally different whilst looking at the same subject – a face in a tree, a shape in a shadow, a story in a reflection – and provokes the question “What is it we truly see in front of us?”."
