Yoga's philosophy is translated into the crisp simplicity of the design, down a cobbled path into a courtyard garden, the modernist facade is striking and simiple. The two studios have light pouring in through a grid of square lightwells in the ceiling; and ceiling-mounted panels can be opened to create one space large enough for 70 yoga practitioners.",

                "Tucked away down a wooded lane in Maida Vale, the front elevation comprises a stout, low wall, evocative of the fortified walls of a medieval keep. Beyond is a small courtyard, then a glazed timber screen enclosing the spacious, light-filled reception hall.",
                "On entering the centre you’ll be struck by its brightness and simplicity. The flooring is pale maple wood, (please remove your shoes as you enter), and natural light pours in through a grid of square light ceiling wells and full-height glazing. Our large yoga studio occupies the rear portion of the building, and can be divided into three smaller units by fold-back acoustic partition screens.",
                "The architect’s aim was to achieve a perfect union of mind and matter, and the design of the Iyengar Yoga London studios reflects yoga philosophy, helping free you from external disturbance. Underfloor heating makes the timber flooring warm and comfortable to sit and lie on, and panels of opaque glass blocks let in light and protect privacy. On the gable wall, glass doors look out on a small sheltered garden.",
