                "The Wilderness is a wonderful haven for wildlife and a hidden gem in Croydon, South London.",
                "Its creator, Rev. William Wilks (1843-1923), vicar of St Johns Church in Shirley was a keen horticulturist, and secretary general of Royal Horticultural Society for thirty-two years. One of his main achievements was the selective breeding of the 'Shirley' poppy, from a poppy he found in a local field with white banding on the edges of the petals.",
                "Wilks was also an enthusiastic botanist and a disciple of William Robinson, a prominent wildlife gardener and writer.",
                "After purchasing land adjacent to the vicarage in 1904,  and on retirement in 1912, he built a house naming it The Wilderness.  He set about creating the garden, details of which were regularly published in the Gardener's chronicle.",
                "(1920 article) - 'True to our expectations we found a most beautiful pleasaunce laid out and planted on unorthodox lines, but embodying the true features of a natural garden'.",
                "After Wilks' death, the garden remained in existence  and was bequeathed to MHA in 1958, when it became Hall Grange care home.",
                "Unfortunately, from the late 1980's onwards, the garden became overgrown and invasive species such as Rhododendron ponticum became a problem.",
                "A local librarian and eventual resident to Hall Grange, Lucy Rogers, long championed the garden, drawing attention to the significant ecological value of the garden, including the rare bog habitat.  This is now a Site of Metropolitan Interest, given the rare species and it being one of very few such habitats in the greater London area.",
                "In 2018, with National Heritage Lottery funding the garden began its conservation journey to  continue Wilks' legacy of enhancing and encouraging native species and wildlife and promoting sustainable gardening practices.  This is being realised with a team of dedicated volunteers working alongside the Head Gardener, Lucy James.",
                "The garden's design is fully accessible to residents in MHA Hall Grange, especially those living with dementia.  It is also utilised by the local community, with ongoing and developing partnerships with  local organisations such as CALAT, Mencap, Turf Projects, and Active Lives, Every3Seconds, CVA and Shirley Methodist Church.",
                "The Wilderness is open to the public during the week and is registered on the Dementia Friendly Venue Charter."
