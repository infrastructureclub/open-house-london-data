                "The extension introduces a green roof, offering ecological benefits, improved insulation, and a softened visual profile from above. This sustainable touch underscores the project’s forward-thinking ethos while respecting its surroundings within the conservation area.\nA key feature is an elegant bamboo window seat overlooking new planters and thoughtfully integrated into the new layout. This charming element not only adds character but also provides a place of quiet retreat, linking indoor living spaces with views of the garden. It’s a small but powerful gesture that captures the spirit of the project: bringing comfort, light, and life back into a previously disconnected home. Another key feature of the project is the innovative first-floor layout, which includes a novel solution for accessing the loft. This approach avoids locating the new stair above the existing stairwell,  preserving the original volume and clearance in front of the stairwell's window. It’s a subtle yet clever rethinking of circulation, demonstrating how thoughtful design can solve practical challenges with elegance."
