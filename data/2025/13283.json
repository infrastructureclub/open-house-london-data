We'll explore the range of 1930s architectural styles used in some famous and not so famous buildings, and even take a peek inside where we can.",

                "Bloomsbury is famed for its Georgian terraces, but during the 1930s a new wave of development made its mark. Great institutions such as the University of London moved into the area, while modern blocks of flats offered housing for a new generation.  We'll take a wander eastwards from Tottenham Court road to see how architects made use of major architectural styles of the era - Art Deco, Neo-Georgian,  Streamline Moderne and even the Mock Tudor style more often associated with the suburban semi. The walk will take in famous London landmarks such as Charles Holden's great Senate House. It will also include interesting surprises, including the London base for Welsh bards and singers, and a rare chance to see inside a 1935 block of speculative flats built for the modern young woman about town, complete with cage lift as seen in the movie Mona Lisa. We'll end the walk at a perfectly preserved 1930s pub down a secret mews."
