                "Bough Terrace is a remodelled Victorian pied-a-terre in the heart of Knightsbridge. Peeling back the layers of the existing house allowed its historic bones to be revealed and celebrated. New solid timbers are juxtaposed with original floor joists and roof trusses to create an intriguing conversation between past and present. The new joinery starts in the basement as a single post and progressively branches out through the three floors finishing in a lightweight lattice and ply canopy at roof level. A sculptural deep midnight blue staircase ascends all floors. Carefully installed to float off the walls, it gives the illusion of a levitating entity. \n \nPreviously smothered and obscured in a flat white render, the houseâ€™s facade has been meticulously restored to reflect its neighbouring Victorian terrace. PVC windows were replaced with double glazed timber sash windows, and an in-built bench now spans the parapet wall enclosing the front courtyard. A dark timber structure extends in both directions from an original arched window above the front door, forming a canopy over the doorstep whilst zoning the entrance vestibule inside. Suspended white panels frame this entrance space, cleverly creating a subtle distinction from the living room whilst providing a neat shoe store beneath.",
                "Reclaimed timber floorboards line the ground floor, a reflection of the timber joists that span the ceiling above. There is a staircase positioned at each end of the room, one of which is concealed behind a wall and leads down to the lower ground floor. A large, timber sash window draws natural light into the living room while an original chimney breast acts as a focal point; exposed and painted in a limewash across all the three storeys to visually heighten the space and add a sense of continuity throughout. Excess pitch pine rafters, removed during renovation, have been reinterpreted to form the body of a bespoke bench supported by new Douglas Fir legs, indicative of the house as a whole.     \n \nThe main bedroom and ensuite are on the first floor, where dark roof trusses create a striking contrast with the plywood ceiling. The bed sits atop an in-built timber platform with storage drawers underneath, while timber floorboards extend towards the exposed, lime washed chimney breast. Positioned adjacent, the ensuite sits at the top of the stairwell. A rooflight channels natural light into the room, floating above a bespoke Japanese soaking bathtub with a raw iroko wood tap which will soften over time. A natural resin finish covers the walls to enhance the sense of tranquillity.",
                "Due to the small scale of the property and quiet nature of the residential street we will be touring a maximum of 10 people around the building every 30 minutes or so."
