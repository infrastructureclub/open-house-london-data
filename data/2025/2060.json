                "Known for many years as the Independent North Mansion, the building was originally christened Belgrave Villa by Sidney Herbert, and later simply The Villa by his successor, the 6th Duke of Richmond.",
                "49 Belgrave Square is a four-storey mansion built around 1851 for Sidney Herbert (later Lord Herbert of Lea) by Thomas Cubitt, in his later manner — quoined and astylar, with a canted bow. The porch and octagonal hall were added in 1859 by Mayhew and Knight, and the interiors were later modified by Mewes and Davis before 1914.",
                "Due to its location between Halkin Street and Grosvenor Crescent, the house was long referred to as The Independent North Mansion. In 1928, after the death of the 7th Duke of Richmond, the house was acquired by gold and diamond magnate Sir Otto Beit. It was then sold by his son, Sir Alfred Beit, in 1936, when it became the official residence of the Argentine Ambassador to the United Kingdom.",
                "Since then, the historic mansion has belonged to Argentina, complete with its original furniture and artworks. Its sumptuous interiors remain intact, with a remarkable collection of paintings, furniture, tapestries, lamps, mirrors, and decorative objects — all contributing to the grandeur and charm of a bygone era."

These rooms lead successively into the spacious DINING ROOM with its cream panelled walls and dark pink marble fireplace.",
                "The grand STAIRCASE at the end of the main hallway near the entrance to the dining room has black-painted wrought iron ornamentation and a brass rail. It curves round to the first-floor landing, at the further end of which a similar spiral staircase continues to the upper floors below an oblong skylight.",

                "Increasingly over recent years, the Residence has hosted conferences, concerts and presentations with the aim of promoting cultural and business links between Argentina and the United Kingdom. The Argentine Ambassador’s Residence has witnessed many significant events throughout the last 70 years, such as: the creation of the emblem of the Argentine Volunteer Squadron in the Second World War; the lodging of the very young John Kennedy; and a bomb falling in 1941 which did not in fact explode. In addition — the reception organised in 1990 for the restitution of diplomatic relations between Buenos Aires and London; the official visits of three Argentine presidents; and two contemporary art exhibitions, ‘Casa Abierta – Open House,’ which took place during Open House London 2006 and 2010.",
                "Now, for the 19th year running, we invite visitors to delve into Argentina’s cultural roots — from design and music to the arts — and to experience a journey through Belgrave Villa’s history and architecture, with its sumptuous interiors still intact, including a collection of paintings, furniture and tapestries. Nineteen years ago, in 2006, the Argentine Ambassador’s Residence became the first Embassy to open its doors to the public for Open House London."
