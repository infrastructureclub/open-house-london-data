                "Our founder, Dr Faith Spicer, was an impressive woman. Back in 1969 she had the idea to set up a support service for adolescents that combined contraceptive advice with counselling and psychotherapy. She was years ahead of her time in offering such a holistic service for young people.\nBrandon Cadbury, (of the famous philanthropic chocolatiers) was so impressed by Faith’s work that he donated our current building in Kentish Town to the charity and as a thank you, we named the charity after him in 1984.",
                "We’re so fortunate to continue to have a close relationship with the Cadbury family through The Oakdale Trust who very generously support us on a regular basis and Brandon’s daughter Olivia Tatton-Brown is our very special Patron.\nFaith’s vision still drives our work today, as we continue to push the boundaries of innovation to help more young people harness their strengths and become responsible, fulfilled, and healthy young adults."
