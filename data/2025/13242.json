                "The Soanes Centre was built in 1993 as a purpose-built environmental study and community centre within Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park. It was managed directly by local government for the first three years, but despite ambitions to develop it as a key borough-wide resource, it closed in 1996 due to a lack of funding. In 1997, it was renovated and reopened by Setpoint London East (at the time operating as SATRO), and has been run as a pioneering outdoor education centre serving the local area ever since. Each year, more than 8,000 East London schoolchildren use the centre to learn about nature and the environment and develop their scientific curiosity. Outside of school hours, it is a community space used by many different groups.",
                "The building was designed by architects Robson Kelly, who also worked on its renovation. While today it may read as a somewhat unglamorous building typical of the 1990s, it included a few unusual features that spoke to aspirations for its role as an environmental study centre – from an early example of a green roof, to a watercourse running through the entrance hall that would allow for pond dipping indoors!",
                "The Soanes Centre is part of a generation of community buildings that, after 30 years of use, are in need of investment. Setpoint London East are aiming to model a community-led retrofit that will future-proof the building, bring greater flexibility to its use, and embed environmental education into every stage of the design and renovation process at no cost to the local authority."

                "The campaign recently presented 2,000 signatures in support of Setpoint being granted a lease for the Soanes Centre to the Council, alongside Mudchute Farm and Leila’s Shop, who have also been campaigning on lease issues.",
                "Conversations about the centre’s future are still ongoing, but a lease has not been offered."
