                "Dive into the architectural splendour of the London Aquatics Centre, one of the most iconic venues born from the legacy of the 2012 Olympic Games. Designed by world-renowned architect Zaha Hadid, this breath-taking structure is inspired by the fluidity of water, with a sweeping wave-like roof that has become a landmark of contemporary design in East London. Originally built to host the Olympic swimming, diving and synchronised swimming events, the Centre is now operated by Everyone Active and thrives as a vibrant community hub, welcoming visitors of all ages and abilities to experience world-class aquatic facilities. During the Open House Festival, guests will have the unique opportunity to explore its design and construction, viewing the cutting-edge engineering solutions that allowed the Centre to transform from an Olympic venue into a dynamic public space. Whether you're an architecture enthusiast, a sports lover, or simply curious about Londonâ€™s evolving urban landscape, the London Aquatics Centre promises an inspiring and immersive visit."
