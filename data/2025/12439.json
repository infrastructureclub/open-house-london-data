                "Kensal House was commissioned by the Gaslight and Coke Company, to showcase their ability to provide gas powered energy.  Design by Maxwell Fry won a competition for the site, basing the buildings around the circular footprint of an old gas tower.  Housing consultant Elizabeth Denby worked as a housing officer for ten years before collaborating on the design. The principle of \"community in action\" was at the core of the design ethos, with communal facilities provided - a nursery, allotments, garden, playground, offices, carpentry workshop, textiles workshop and a community theatre. It is the first modernist housing estate for working class residents."

Balanced proportions allow light and space for all with two balconies, sleek white rendering, Crittall windows, and ingenious use of light following the 'Zeilenbau' principle, meaning bedrooms are warmed by sunshine in the morning and the living and kitchen spaces are lit with sunshine in the afternoon and evening."
