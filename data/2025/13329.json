Triple glazing, underfloor heating, and low-energy lighting enhance sustainability. A glazed landing links old and new, with bamboo landscaping for privacy.",

                "Originally a 1970s contemporary house, the building featured large glazed windows but no longer met the needs of a modern family or flexible live/work lifestyle. The project involved a major remodelling to create a home that is both functional for contemporary living and respectful of the original structure, while also future-proofing it for generations to come.\nKey interventions included relocating the entrance door from the side of the house to the front, improving visibility and arrival experience, and repositioning the staircase to enhance flow and connectivity. A substantial three-level extension was added, seamlessly integrated through the creation of an ‘internal street’ that links old and new, and brings the outside in.",
                "Sustainability and sensitivity to the existing fabric were central to the design approach. Natural materials were used throughout, and features such as underfloor heating and double-height spaces were introduced to enhance comfort and spatial quality. The result is a carefully balanced home that celebrates both its original character and its new, environmentally conscious future.",
