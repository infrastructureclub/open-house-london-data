                "The project was above all a collaboration with our clients who had just started a family. We began working with them during Covid lockdown. The clients wanted a central space to connect all adjacent activities and together we developed an infill extension at the rear of the Victorian property which would give coherence to the existing addition and better internal connection between the spaces at ground floor. A new dining space was conceived that would act as a ‘thread’ connecting the various spaces through which it passes. The concept echoes a ‘street party’ style of dining, where the table shifts and extends when needed, rather than being defined by a dedicated dining ‘room’. This hard working new addition allows the family to be flexible with supper clubs spilling into the kitchen and the garden when extra space is needed. The communal act of eating is central to this project and we hope many feasts will be enjoyed post-Covid."

                "The new garden room nestles against the walls and openings of the existing house, using unaltered openings and resting gently against existing structure. Exposed timber and glazing encourages light to pour into the new space. The floor is a bespoke design using Bert & May floor tiles in a unique pattern inspired by external cobbled paving.",
                "The existing kitchen was retained in its existing location but usability and capacity improved with the simple insertion of a worktop and a new utility space including a shower room. The bread oven which existed in the original house, and was a feature the clients liked about the house, is restored and celebrated with sliding pocket doors revealing glimpses of it from the snug.",
                "Natural materials were chosen and deliberately left exposed to give an external outdoor feeling to the new space. A textured plaster from Clayworks was chosen for the new walls in a warm hue and left exposed internally with the same finish internally and externally. Three gloss colours define the spaces that surround the new garden room: dark blue for the snug, yellow for the pantry and a teal for the kitchen island. The latter was chosen for its prominent use across South and South East Asia in kitchens and local restaurants. The client wanted to include it and after testing with nimtim, the kitchen island was identified as a good focal point for coming together over food within the new internal space.",
                "‘We found NimTim and immediately loved their projects - creative, interesting and combining the existing with something innovative and adventurous. Working with them has been great. From the initial meetings right through to completion they’ve been focused on what we wanted to achieve, how we were intending to use the space and incorporated our ideas and preferences at all times. It’s been a long time in the making, and with a fair few setbacks along the way, but NimTim have always been resilient and persevered to help us realise our ambition with our home. They combine an understanding of how individuals interact with space with a keen eye for aesthetics and design - and we’ve see that come to life.",
                "We wanted to create a new space in our home - for dining, relaxing, working and hosting - whilst also keeping areas distinct and individual. The kitchen was always really important for us. as we love cooking and hosting. We wanted to connect with the living and working spaces but also be able to get down to business when we needed to.’",
                "When we bought our house we loved all the details and wanted to make the most of its features, highlighting its origins and sensitively creating something new that works alongside it. We love the end result and still catch ourselves staring at it and pinching ourselves that it’s ours.'"
