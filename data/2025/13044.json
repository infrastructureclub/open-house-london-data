                "The Space, formerly St Paul’s church, was built by a Presbyterian mission, that had formed in the area around 1856. The site was acquired from the Earl of Strafford in 1859 and the church constructed to the design of T.E. Knightley. The foundation stone was laid by John Scott Russell, the Scottish builder of the “Great Eastern” ship, who ran the nearby shipyard at Burrells Wharf. The church was built by J.& F.J. Woods of Mile End for a cost of £750, excluding the cost of extra foundations.",
                "In 1866 attendances had fallen to 6, but possibly due to the effects of a depression, there were more than 100 worshippers by the following year. This resulted in the construction of a gallery at the west end. In 1906 a nondescript two storey addition was added to the rear to provide space for a vestry, classrooms, and a kitchen. The extension was designed by T Phillips Figgis and built by the Limehouse firm of Harris and Wardop.",
                "Following the closure of the London Docks large parts of the Isle of Dogs went into a phase of decline. St Paul’s ceased being used as a church in 1972 and the congregation moved to a new church at Island House, Castalia Square. The building was then used by the owners of the adjacent site for testing crane components. A large window in the south elevation was removed and the two large doors that are seen today inserted.",
                "In 1989 a locally based group of individuals created the St Paul’s Arts Trust with a view to taking responsibility for the building, restoring it and creating a venue for the arts.",
                "The success of the Trust has owed a lot to the knowledge and energy of its Project Director, Robert Richardson, who had significant experience of projects of this nature and has seen the scheme through from start to finish. A first phase of underpinning and emergency works was completed in 1993. Work on the restoration and conversion began in 1994 to the designs of architects Claxton d'Auvergne Collings of Fulham. Significant grant funding was given by the London Docklands Development Corporation, English Heritage, the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, the Heritage of London Trust, the Pilgrim Trust, Esmee Fairbairn Charitable Trust and the National Lottery, via the Arts Council of England.",
                "The Space opened in 1996 and has been providing creative opportunities for local residents and support for a wide range of artists ever since."
