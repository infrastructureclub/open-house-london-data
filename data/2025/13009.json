The original building is part of a handsome cluster of twelve modernist homes, all built around a communal garden. Originally designed by architects Ted Levy, Benjamin & Partners in the late 1960s, the scheme represents a key part of progressive post war design thinking in Camden, and Londonâ€™s, built history."

                "Studio Hagen Hall revived the house for a growing family, with a keen focus on upgrading its overall energy efficiency and performance. Every element of the property was addressed and considered in detail, from reconfiguring layouts and creating bespoke interiors & joinery, to upgrading the external envelope and implementing a renewable energy strategy.",
                "Under the surface, the comprehensive set of performance improvement strategies (including both envelope upgrades and renewable technologies) have helped reduce heating demand by 77%, and annual carbon emissions by 93% - meaning that the embodied carbon included in the retro-fit is eclipsed (or netted out) by reductions in emissions in little over a year.",
                "The scheme exemplifies Studio Hagen Hall's approach to enhancing and respecting post-war residential architecture, prioritising a rich dialogue between the existing character and contemporary interventions. Specifically, the retrofit and refurbishment of Pine Heath blends sensitive restoration with necessary sustainability, and proves that upgrading precious post-war housing stock is not only possible, but can lead to contextual and highly crafted results that honour their roots while looking firmly to the future."
