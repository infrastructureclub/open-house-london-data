                "Constructed across a landscape of market gardeners fields and orchards, and opened by King George V, in May 1925, the road became a catalyst for the rapid suburban development of Heston, Hounslow and Isleworth. And it's 'golden mile' to the west of Chiswick Roundabout became a corridor of  inter war, Art Deco by-pass factories, of which J.B.

Openings have segmental red-brick arches. The windows are large 4-pane sashes, paired on the ground-floor. On the left (west) side, 2 doors take the place of windows, and give direct access to meeting rooms; two corbelled lateral stacks. Roof half-hipped to rear.",
