                "Seed Archives is a research space and community library celebrating traditional African and Caribbean art, design, and culture through an innovative approach that bridges the physical and digital realms. Founded by photographer Christian, the project began with collecting and selling antique objects, which naturally evolved into scanning and sharing books on material culture online to make the knowledge more accessible.",
                "Over the past year, Seed has curated an impressive collection of over 200 out-of-print books focused on art, design, and culture relating to Africa and the Caribbean. What sets Seed apart is its tactile approach, visitors are actively encouraged to touch and handle both books and cultural objects, creating a more engaging and intimate learning experience that challenges the traditional \"look but don't touch\" approach of conventional cultural institutions.",
                "By reimagining the concept of an archive, Seed transforms how people engage with cultural objects and knowledge, offering free educational resources and encouraging collective approaches to learning. The space recognises that understanding culture requires more than visual observation, it demands physical connection and sensory engagement.",
                "Currently based in Tottenham, Seed operates as a free library every Saturday, working to ensure cultural knowledge remains accessible to the community while fostering deeper connections between visitors and the rich traditions of the African and Caribbean diaspora."
