                "The 1960's were a time of flux and innovation and the recently listed church of St Richard's in Ham by Ralph Covell of Covell Matthews and Partners was a product of both.  Three rare timber hyperbolic paraboloid shells rising from a unique star of David floor plan result in a distinctive external profile and a soaring, light filled interior. Vibrant dalle de verre stained glass by Henry Haig depicts incidents from the life of St Richard and are complemented by two unusual enamelled doors. The church forms the centre piece of a mature housing estate by Wates which has maintained its design integrity through active management by the residents.  Today the building successfully holds together its function as a church and a space for community activities and events. \nLocal architects Richard and Fiona Woolf will give short introductory talks on the building and the dalle de verre stained glass each hour."
