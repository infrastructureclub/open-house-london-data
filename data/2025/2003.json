Many of the prominent figures of the Arts and Crafts Movement were active members of the Guild and its principle of ‘learning by doing’ soon spread through art education and had a worldwide influence."

Designed by F. W. Troup, the hall is a fine example of Arts and Crafts design. It houses portraits and sculptures of the Guild's Masters from its foundation to the present day.",
                "Until recently a utilitarian outside space, the courtyard was redesigned in 2016 by Simon Hurst and is now covered with a beautiful glazed barrel vault roof supported by cast iron ribs. Designed and crafted by the Guild’s own members, it complements the existing architecture, in that its aesthetics are craft-orientated and largely handmade."

We represent over 60 creative disciplines, including sculptors, architects, textile artists, potters, graphic designers, glass engravers, jewellers, furniture makers and printers. It is a place where traditional skills meet modern design and method, where creative connections are forged, and the work of the hand and ‘learning by doing’ are celebrated.",
                "The Art Workers’ Guild is a registered charity that advances education in all the visual arts and crafts by means of lectures, meetings, demonstrations, and discussions. It fosters and maintains high standards of design and craftsmanship in all branches of the visual arts and crafts, in any way which may be beneficial to the community.",
                "Besides hosting the Guild's own lectures and events, the hall and other rooms are made available for the meetings of some 70 other arts-based bodies, so that it is estimated that between 25 - 30,000 people use the building every year to attend events, educational lectures and study groups on the visual and decorative arts and crafts.",
                "The Guild runs a varied and wide-ranging Outreach programme of practical workshops, exhibitions, demonstrations, collaborative projects, and discussions. The programme brings the diverse skills of our members to a broad range of people including students, educators and academics, policy makers, medical professionals, scientists and engineers, families, young people, and refugees. We hope that everyone who participates gains an insight into the many ways in which craftsmanship and making nurture creative thinking, and how these can play an important role in everyone's life."
