                "In 2010, Soho Estates began an extensive regeneration of the Walker’s Court area which included the reopening the Boulevard Theatre in October 2019. The venue pays tribute to the original theatre and is situated on the original site. Designed by architects SODA studio and theatre consultants Charcoal Blue.",
