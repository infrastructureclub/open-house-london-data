Each pavilion accommodates a room and has a roof that slopes on all four sides with a top light over the middle. This shape reduces the contour, whilst maximizing the volume. The top light offers fantastic natural light.",
                "Secondary spaces such as toilets and stairs are hidden within the capacious double walls of the links between pavilions, so that the final design reads as an enfilade of generous top lit spaces. The pavilions are gently moulded to make efficient use of the site.",
