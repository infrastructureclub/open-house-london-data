                "Andaz London Liverpool Street is a 5-star hotel in central London, just south of Liverpool Street station. Originally built as the Great Eastern Hotel in 1884, the building has undergone several renovations, including significant expansions from 1899 to 1901 and another in 2000 under co-owner Terence Conran. Since 2006, Hyatt has owned the hotel, operating it under the Andaz brand.",
                "The hotel, a Grade II listed building since March 1993, stands on the site of England's first mental hospital, Bethlehem Royal Hospital, also known as 'Bedlam.' Designed by Charles Barry, Jr. and Edward Middleton Barry, the hotel was built by the Lucas Brothers and completed in 1884. An additional section, the Abercorn Rooms, was added by Robert William Edis in the 1890s.",
                "The hotel's early clientele included businesspeople looking to avoid City traffic by staying near the railway station. By 1908, the hotel, then known as the Liverpool Street Hotel, advertised its proximity to the London Underground and offered fresh sea water for bathing, brought in by train. The building is notable for its two Masonic Temples: an Egyptian temple in the basement and a Grecian temple on the first floor, which hosted Caledonian Lodge No. 134 from 1920 to 1947.",
                "In the latter half of the twentieth century, the hotel required refurbishment. After the nearby railway station was redesigned in the 1980s, the hotel followed suit. In 1996, The Manser Practice, known for their work on a Hilton hotel at Heathrow Airport, was awarded the refurbishment contract. They added a new lobby by removing several guest rooms and increased the total number of rooms to 267 by repurposing attic space. The redesign incorporated daylighting techniques, using lightwells in the lobby and main dining room to maximize views of London.",
                "Today, Andaz London Liverpool Street offers 267 rooms, including 15 suites. The red brick building with stucco and stone-ground floor features a mildly classical style. Guests can enjoy seven bars and restaurants, a fitness center, and a steam room.",
                "The hotel has notable literary connections: in Bram Stoker's Dracula, vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing stays at the Great Eastern, and in W. G. Sebald's Austerlitz, the narrator meets the titular character in the hotel bar, where Austerlitz details the building's Grecian temple."

The hotel itself, however, offers much more than just a prime location. Guests can enjoy uniquely decorated rooms, exciting brunches, and indulgent afternoon teas.",
                "The Lobby:\nThe lobby features a striking wall created by the local art collective Le Gun, and a replica of a famous rhino artwork by local graffiti artist Otto Schade, originally seen in Shoreditch. The influence of the building’s railway history is evident throughout the lobby, from plush velvet seating reminiscent of old train cars to riveted desks that evoke vintage travel trunks.",
                "The Rooms:\nAndaz London offers 267 spacious and modern guest rooms, including 15 suites. Each room captures the hotel’s unique blend of history and contemporary style, where the traditionally conservative City of London meets the ever-evolving artistic vibe of East London. The minimalist decor is punctuated with vibrant pops of color and creative touches. Luxurious bathrooms are well-equipped, and the large, cozy beds ensure a restful night’s sleep.",
