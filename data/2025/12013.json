With an impressive double hammerbeam roof, open hearth and a high table said to be the gift of the Queen herself, it was a Hall fit for a confident, flourishing and prestigious Inn of Court.",
                "Queen Elizabeth I is known to have visited in 1578, and at the Candlemas Feast in 1602 the first known performance of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night took place, recorded in the diary of John Manningham, a student at the time.",
                "In its 450-year history, the Hall has been the backdrop to the education of countless generations of barristers, and played host to feasting, music, drama and dancing. It is also home to an array of remarkable collections, including royal portraits by Lely, Kneller and Murray, and one of the most impressive displays of heraldic art in London, in the form of painted armorial panels and stained glass, dating back to the 16th century."

                "The Library is also home to the only known pair of Molyneux Globes, the earliest globes made in England. The celestial and terrestrial globes were orginally made in 1592, but the terrestrial globe was updated in 1603. They will be on display for visitors to see on the day.",

The Queen's Room was named for Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, Royal Bencher of the Inn from 1944 to 2002, and is graced by a portrait of Her Majesty in a Bencher's gown."
