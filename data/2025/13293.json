                "The Bishopsgate Institute, as well as containing one of the largest archive of objects donated by 2SLGBTQIA+ people in the UK, also hosts The Museum of Transology’s archive, which similarly contains one of the largest collections of artefacts describing trans, intersex and non-binary lived experience. Many of the entries describe the everyday as well as trans+ activism. Given recent developments and rollbacks of these rights to privacy and space both direct and indirect, it is more important than ever to understand architecture's role in upholding and challenging political and cultural ideas.\nThis workshop, led by Scar Barclay, an architectural designer and exhibition designer for TRANSCESTRY, will collectively use donated items from the collection and their owners' stories to draw out their spatial relationships and dwell on what trans spatiality and spatial justice is (and can become). Come ready to draw, read, sit and work together."
