These were truly 'art in everyday life', especially the beautiful finial sculptures that sat on posts for washing lines in the courtyards. Tragically over 150 of these beautiful 1930s ceramics have disappeared –  now selling at auctions for private collections, a far cry from the working-class public art they were intended as.",
