Its iconic Art Deco building opened in 1933 and a unique, supportive community was established on the surrounding estate. Today, a small team makes Remembrance wreaths by hand, and the charity supports veterans and families on the path to employment across the UK. A new visitor centre opened in 2021 after a full refurbishment.",

                "The original factory building was in Old Kent Road, east London, where a growing team of veterans quickly outgrew the premises.  In 1926, The Poppy Factory moved to Richmond upon Thames, where a thriving community of veterans worked year-round making Remembrance wreaths and poppies for the Royal British Legion and the Royal Family. Many lived with their families in purpose-built flats on the Richmond estate.",

Since we started developing and expanding our services in 2010, The Poppy Factory has helped thousands of veterans and family members to make progress on path to all kinds of employment, starting more than 3,000 new jobs."
