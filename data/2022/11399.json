                "-\tWoolwich Works opened its doors in September 2021 after a multi-million-pound restoration project by the Royal Borough of Greenwich. \n-\tNow a multidisciplinary arts venue, it has recently been named London's ‘best new spot for culture’ by Time Out.\n-\tThe Woolwich Works buildings are home to an 1800 capacity event space, a courtyard, five rehearsal studios, artists' studios and offices for resident companies and a cafe / bar\n-\tWoolwich Works stands on a larger historic site where the first recorded house was built in the 1540s during the Tudor period.\n-\tThe Board of Ordnance purchased the site in 1671 to store materials as it was near to the dockyards and would help them greatly expand their operations. The site was then developed for military purposes.\n-\tFrom 1806, the area became a fully self-contained factory complex during the Crimean War which functioned, in parts, for over a century.\n-\tIn 1886, factory workers on the site formed Dial Square FC which would go on to relocate and become the team we know today as Arsenal.\n-\tThe Woolwich Arsenal is also remembered as the Secret City. During WW1 it employed around 80,000 people, around half of whom were women. Into the Second World War, the Secret City retained its role in the production line until manufacturing ceased in 1967, and the Ministry of Defence departed in 1994.\n-\tA wide range of notable people have either worked at or visited these buildings including suffragettes, prime ministers, and royalty from all over the world."
