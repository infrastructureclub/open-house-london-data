By the 1980s and 1990s it had become an important local resource, housing a community centre, which provided a laundry, youth club, nursery and play and amenity space.",

The garden is open to the public during the growing season and residents all year round. It hosts arts events and gardening workshops free of charge and provides a meeting space for local groups in the borough, from NHS nurses to student film makers."
