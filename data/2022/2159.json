                "This beautiful Grade II Listed building was originally called “Warren House”, a name derived from the wooded valley on the west side of the house, know locally as the Warren because it was overrun with rabbits.  Built by Walter Maximilian de Zoete, the son of a stockbroker who was noted for his conservatism and a man who also disliked any changes, designed in a Flemish style which is noticeable in the stepped gables, a style not common in this country.",
                "In 1885 the leasehold interest was assigned to Martin R Smith, who added another 16 acres to the six acre site and then over the years built a new wing, a billiards room, two cottages, a summer house and glasshouses.",
                "In 1909 the house became the property of Sir Robert Laidlaw M.P, the original particulars can be seen below when the house was auctioned on 9th June 1909. Robert Laidlaw loaned his mansion to the Red Cross during the First World war, during this time he also donated £25 per week, a fully equipped operating theatre, use of his five servants and as much produce from the gardens as needed.",
                "Warren House sheltered 630 patients during its term as an Auxiliary Hospital, some returned to the battlefield, those who survived kept up the friendships they made at Warren House for many years after the war."
