                "Jellicoe Gardens opened in November 2021 as part of a coherent collection of linked green spaces in King’s Cross, each defined by its diversity and quality. In the garden and pavilion, sunlight, shade and water are balanced to create a place of calm, comfort, and quiet reflection in the heart of the King’s Cross Estate. Inspiration has been taken primarily from the great garden Bagh-e Fin, a traditional Persian garden located in Kashan, Iran. The pavilion celebrates geometry and symmetry and is bisected by an axial water feature. The patterned roof is a symbolised ode to traditionally covered pavilions in Persian Gardens and features a geometrical aperiodic pattern of Penrose tiling created by British physicist Robert Penrose. The nod to the equilibrium created by sunlight, shade, and water creates a calm destination primed for quiet reflection.",
                "While the garden’s layout is undeniably Persian in origin, the naturalistic drifts of planting are developed from the traditional English herbaceous border where the planting has an informal, meadow-like character, drawing the eye across swathes of colour and texture. The name of the gardens reflects the achievements of Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe (8 October 1900 – 17 July 1996), a notable landscape architect, planner, and architect."
