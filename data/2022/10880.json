                "9 Fitzroy Square was designed by Robert Adam as one of a row of houses on the eastern side of Fitzroy Square. Designed in the neoclassical style, the houses were built speculatively to attract wealthy aristocratic families. The lease for the site was given to the Adam brothers in 1792 and building commenced in 1794. As Robert died in 1792, the houses were completed by his brothers James and William.",

                "The house is built from Portland stone with a slate mansard roof and dormers. The building has 3 storeys, an attic and a basement, which opens onto a small paved enclosed courtyard garden at the rear.",
                "The round-arched doorway features pilaster-jambs carrying a cornice-head; fanlight and panelled door. There is a plain band at 1st floor level. The windows are square-headed recessed sash windows, with cast-iron balconies on the first floor. The house features a cornice and balustraded parapet. Attached are cast-iron railings with urn finials to areas.",
