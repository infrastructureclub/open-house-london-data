Founders James Grundy and Felix James had always enjoyed a great tasting beer. On the search for one that they could enjoy whilst maintaining an active, fast-paced lifestyle, they were surprised that they could not find consistently great tasting beer below 2.8%. Combining modern know-how with classical brewing methods, they set out on a mission to reignite the lost tradition of Small Beer, historically a staple in British daily life."

In recent years it housed a commercial laundry and a logistics company specialising in electronic components, until it was identified by budding entrepreneurs James Grundy and Felix James as the ideal location to set up the Small Beer Brewery. A series of internal partition walls and mezzanine floor were designed by Garbers & James Architects and built in 2018, incorporating the brewery bar, offices and storage rooms."
