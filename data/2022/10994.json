                "The foundation stone for thisbuilding was laid in 1901.It was designed by Henry Cheers and Joseph Smith in the Renaissance style, built by D.W. Barker and was officially opened by the philanthropist, John Passmore Edwards, on 5 February 1903. \nThe design involved an asymmetrical main frontage with six bays facing onto Barking Road; the right-hand section featured a 150-foot (46 m) high tower and a large archway to the extreme right inscribed with the words \"Public Hall\" above. A long extension to the south of the main building was completed in 1910 and a three-storey annexe was built to the east on Barking Road in 1939. Internally, the principal rooms were the public hall, the council chamber and the mayor's parlour.",

The East Ham Urban District was given municipal borough status in 1904, and county borough status in 1915. The building continues to be the local seat of government after the formation of the London Borough of Newham in 1965, serving as its administrative headquarters."
