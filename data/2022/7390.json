                "The design represents a high quality, mixed use development that makes a significant and positive contribution to the public realm, in character, hierarchy and scale, whilst also creating a harmonious whole between the new and the old. An understanding of the urban context and design framework strongly guided our thinking in developing the design. The ground floor spaces have been designed specifically to engage and connect seamlessly with the surrounding buildings and public realm, rather than only serve a large corporate office space.",
                "To enhance the campus environment in the northern quarter the ground floor space will be open to the public during operational hours and create a direct pedestrian route through the building from north to south; with the principle building entrances positioned along the main public routes and spaces, activating street frontages with separate entrances and a range of public uses at ground floor.",
                "We overcame various design challenges to meet the client’s brief. Working with the site restraints within the masterplan and offering maximum flexibility with multiple-tenanted office layout presented a challenging brief for us. We overcome these challenges with continuous and open communication with the client, as well as a series of workshops with the design team.",
                "The final design has created a building of character and originality, with a sculptural form; a stepped massing form with set-backs, which take advantage of the expansive views across London to the south and east, whilst creating valuable external amenity space. The project also accommodates a number of occupiers, all of which have been involved in communication with the design team. We allowed good time to incorporate their specific requirements, which satisfied their brief and crucially, retained the architectural integrity of the building."
