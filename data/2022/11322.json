During the Industrial Revolution, stalls lined the entire length of Walworth Road. \nRunning since 1880, East Street Market is one of the London's oldest, largest and busiest markets in London. It offers a wide variety of goods, from fresh fruit and vegetables to African clothing and materials.",

We also need the governance and working structures to ensure local ownership and governance of these assets.",
                "Fareshares was set up in 1988 by the local community to improve access to good food, based on the belief that decent food is a basic necessity for health, regardless of means. This food cooperative is volunteer-run and has continued to evolve into a dynamic space that functions based on trust and transparency. It creates scope for social innovation, civic governance and asset management at a tangible scale."
