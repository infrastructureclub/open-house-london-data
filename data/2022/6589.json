                "White Collar Factory was the result of an eight-year research project led by AHMM and Derwent London, and comprises a complex of six buildings at Old Street Yard including offices, studios, incubator space, restaurants and apartments set around a new piece of public realm, with a sixteen-storey tower at its heart. Together, these 27,200 sqm buildings provide a bold new marker for Old Street as well as creating a new, more permeable section of the city that references the alleys and passageways of the historic urban grain.\n \nFeaturing long spans, flexible floor plates, operable windows, generous volumes and robust construction, the tower represents a new type of office building that takes its cue from the multi-level factory typology, and uses concrete in several ways. As well as forming the structure, the concrete provides the thermal mass, carries the servicing, and creates a highly expressive finish both inside and out. Board-shuttered concrete wraps the building at pavement level. Above, glazing is interspersed with metal panels punched with ‘portholes’, and banded with powder-coated aluminium spandrel panels."
