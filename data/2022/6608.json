                "The economic downturn of the late 1920s resulted\nin increased unemployment. To combat this\nincreasing unemployment, the Government passed\nthe Development Act in July 1929. This Bill\nsubsidised capital improvement works of local\nauthorities and public bodies - including London\nUnderground.\nAt this time, the Piccadilly line terminated at\nFinsbury Park, where commuters would transfer to\nlocal tram and bus services. However, the station\nhad significant congestion, and there was a public\ncampaign to extend the line northward.\nThe Underground managed to obtain the rights and\ngovernment funding for extending the Piccadilly line\nin June 1930, beginning construction later that\nyear. Many of the station sjavascript:;ites almost chose\nthemselves, as they were locations in which\nexisting bus routes converged. Construction of the line involved both tunnelling and surface construction.\nWhen the first section of the extension opened in\nSeptember 1932, the Underground promoted the\nnew line to residents by distributing 30,000 free\nreturn tickets from Piccadilly Circus station."

                "From the 1920s to the 1940s, Charles Holden was responsible for the design of more than 50 stations and associated buildings across the Underground network. Holden’s station exteriors are architecturally striking and immediately identifiable with the Underground. He was a master of creating interiors that felt generous despite their\noften limited spaces.\nHolden was already a renowned architect and a\npartner in the firm of Adams Holden & Pearson when\nhe began a design partnership with Frank Pick, who\nwould eventually become Managing Director of the\nUnderground. The two were members of the Design\nand Industries Association (DIA), sharing an\nappreciation of ‘fitness for purpose’.",
                "Holden’s first major commission was the 1926 Northern line extension to Morden, followed by high profile\nwork on the Underground’s head office at 55 Broadway and\nPiccadilly Circus, a showcase station for the Underground.",
                "Holden’s designs for the Piccadilly line extensions of\n1932 and 1933 were influenced by the work of\narchitects in Northern Europe, which Holden and Pick\nvisited on a 1930 study tour. Inspired by the buildings\non that tour, Holden based his designs for the\nextension in a foundation of utilitarian materials -\nbrick, concrete, and glass - set in clean geometric\nconfigurations.\nThese designs are deceptively simple. What on paper\nlooks like a collection of lines is transformed when\nbuilt into soaring spaces flooded with natural light,\ncreating environments that inspire calmness and\npeace in those traveling on the Underground.\nHolden’s work on the Cockfosters extension largely\nfalls into two types of building - the Sudbury Box,\nwhich is essentially a rectangular brick structure with a\nconcrete lid, and the drum, in which circular forms\nand shapes take precedence.\nThe advent of the Second World War and the\nretirement of Pick effectively ended Holden’s\ncollaboration with the Underground, but his legacy\ncan still be felt across the network."
