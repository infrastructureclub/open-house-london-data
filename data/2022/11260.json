The new build space was created around a south facing landscaped courtyard from timber frame blockwork and render, It has a highly insulated skin around the various spaces including the double height studio which faces east. The movement studio with its basket weave Maple dance floor, is Caroline Salem's space, (choreographer and movement director)'where she mentors and develops her and others work.  The design and fabrication of the building was inspired by the work of Walter Segal and Ted Cullinan (his Camden Mews house inc. the birch tree) as well as the modernist Berthold Lubetkin (Architect Ed Frith was his gardener in Bristol in the 1980s) His Bristol Triangle Casino sign will be featured, see photographs."
