It is a polar  sundial, in which the gnomon (which casts the shadow) is pointing to the polestar, and the dial plate (which has the hour markings) is parallel to it.  The dial was commissioned by the Worshipful Company of Tylers and Bricklayers to commemorate the Millennium, was built by the Royal Enginners, and was opened by the Lord Mayor in November 1999.  The sundial stands on a plinth of exactly 2000 bricks, one for each year of the two millennia."

The talk will cover the genesis of this sundial, how to read the time from it, and sources of information about sundials.  It will be followed by 5 minutes for questions, and then the cycle will be repeated every quarter-hour.\nPlease also visit the Fleet Street Heritage Sundial at the corner of Fleet Street and Bouverie Street, where similar talks will be given between 9 and 11 each day."
