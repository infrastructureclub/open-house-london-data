                "Architects: Gordon Benson and Alan Forsyth, Camden’s Architecture Department\nAccommodation: 64 flats and maisonettes\nMaterials: concrete block crosswalls on concrete strip footings with concrete floor slabs; blockwork rendered and painted white externally with dark-stained timber joinery",
                "Mansfield Road was designed between 1972 and 1980 by Gordon Benson and Alan Forsyth. After graduating from the Architectural Association in the 1960s, the young architects assisted Neave Brown on his Alexandra Road scheme in Swiss Cottage (now Grade II* listed). Keen to ensure they didn't get restless, bough architect Sydney Cook gave the pair their own housing project — Branch Hill Estate in Hampstead, shortly followed by Mansfield Road and Lamble Street.",
                "Gordon Benson (b. 1944) and Alan Forsyth (b. 1944) joined Camden in 1968 directly from the Architectural Association and initially worked with Neave Brown on the Alexandra Road scheme in Swiss Cottage. Camden’s Borough architect, Sydney Cook, gave the young architects their own housing brief in 1970 for a site in the wealthy area of Hampstead — Branch Hill, and a few year’s later, two sites in Gospel House: Mansfield Road and Lamble Street.",
                "The long terrace of flats on Mansfield Road and houses on Lamble Street were the last parts of the Gospel Oak Redevelopment Area to be completed. Here the architects attempted to restore the feeling of the terraced housing they replaced but without a hint of pastiche. Between them lie Oak Village and Elaine Grove with their attractive pairs of nineteenth-century stuccoed cottages. These only escaped demolition because they had been bought by more wealthy and vociferous owners than at the rear.",
                "Rendered block work is painted white with contrasting woodwork and many of the motifs that have come tobe known as the ‘Camden style’ can be seen here. The spiral staircases on the garden side are similar to Neave Brown’s Winscombe Street houses. The terrace is sunk below street level to match the height of the houses behind. In Mansfield Road, access is by a raised internal gallery which is both separate from the street yet part of it.",
                "The quality of detailing is exceptional and helps to create the unity between exterior and interior. For example red tiles are used not just for the floor of the access gallery but also for the walls, they appear on the tops of the bin chambers and inside the flats. The clever split-level cross section, sky-lights and full-height glazing make the flats and maisonettes seem much larger than their actual size.",
                "Each dwelling has its own front door and is given either a generous roof terrace (A flats), garden or balcony (B flats). The development was neither cheap nor easy to build, and to obtain a tender list Camden had to approach sixty contractors. It took six years and a tower crane was needed — exceptional for three-storey housing on this scale."
