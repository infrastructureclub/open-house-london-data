We invite you to our evening of soup and stories where we’ll be breaking bread, setting the soup to simmer, and listening to a host of songsters, spoken word artists, poets and storytellers. In what used to be the main room of the pub, where many tall tales were once told, we invite you to pull up a stool, listen, and maybe even tell a story or two of your own...",

                "It served as public house up until the early 2000s and we can only begin to imagine the array of costumers it must have had throughout the centuries! Merchants, pirates, dockworkers, people from all over the world have formed a neighbourhood which has borne witness to the British Empire's global exploits. The legacy of the colonial era lies in the streets surrounding the pub: Cotton Street, Nutmeg Lane, East India Dock Road... the list goes on.\n \nSlowly the Docklands could no longer serve as a port: cargo ships grew too big to enter the docks. The former industrial area became the site of post war council housing and, a few decades later, these same houses were to be overshadowed by Canary Wharf. Next to its skyscrapers, a new wave of gentrification is taking over Balfron Tower and Robin Hood Gardens - historical social housing complexes which for their time, were revolutionary in their vision of a new and inclusive urban design.",
                "Since its closure as a pub, The Steamship was first under a property guardianship scheme, then briefly became a squat, and since 2017, it has been a Project Space... or at least that's how we like to call it."

But our community of artists that constitute The Steamship PS is much bigger, making it a space always open to those looking to experiment and create work from the grassroots up.",
