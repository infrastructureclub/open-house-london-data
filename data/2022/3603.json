With the passing of the Epping Forest Act in 1878, illegal enclosure was forbidden and most newly constructed buildings on Forest land had to be demolished, with the exception of religious buildings. The burial grounds include the headstones of Friends buried in Plaistow and Barking, including that of Elizabeth Fry."

This room should have an acoustic suitable for the clear understanding of normal speech, without intrusive echoes.\n􀁸 A social room and adjacent kitchen, suitable for refreshments\n􀁸 Children’s room\n􀁸 Library\n􀁸 Welcoming foyer and circulation space suitable for informal gathering after meetings\n􀁸 Ancillary spaces\n􀁸 Accommodation for a warden\n􀁸 Be a building suitable for use by other community groups and public meetings.",

                "The building is deliberately plain, respecting Quaker testimony for simplicity. It also reflects the architectural ideas of its time, including spaces visually open to the outside, clear modern sculptural forms and a construction optimistic for a time when “energy would be too cheap to meter”.",
