The refurbishment involves a series of additions that has given the practice the opportunity to add a greater range of amenity and social spaces as well as diversity in work settings.

These large, expansive windows are echoed on the other side of the courtyard, where new meeting rooms have been suspended above the existing walkway.",

The inclusion of booth seating in the Teams Hub creates space for private, focused work, and improves accessibility for neurodiversity, by creating further alternative working environments that individuals can choose to best suit their needs."
