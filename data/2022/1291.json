Blomfield was the architect of the Royal College of Music and the rebuilding of Southwark Cathedral, London and several colleges at Cambridge. But in comparison with his former projects, he worked to a smaller budget than his usual commissions and in a more cramped, urban location.",
                "The architecture of Oxford House was in the domestic style of the 16th or 17th century. The Duke of Connaught inaugurated the Victorian building in 1892. The ceremony was attended by the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, six bishops and other ecclesiastical luminaries, underscoring the settlement's religious purpose.",

The new building extension and refurbishment provided a theatre and studio space, with a link structure running along the north side of Oxford House providing level access, a new entrance foyer and gallery spaces."

The southern façade is symmetrical, of seven bays with shallow two-bay cross-wings under pitched roofs with gables of stone hexagonal ball finials, coping and kneelers. The original entrance doors are up a short flight of steps; a foundation stone on the recessed porch wall records November 30th 1891. On the right hand side of the entrance is a Victorian post box set embedded into the wall. To the west is the former clubhouse of 1894, of three bays with a hipped roof. The outer ground-floor bays of the clubhouse, now windows, were originally the entrance doors. A new ramped entrance from Derbyshire Pocket Park was created in 2019."

Furthermore, panelled door reveals and fireplaces survived the last century. A large Tudor-arched fireplace with carved rosettes in the spandrels stands out. It is located in today’s café, the former dining room of the graduates, on the ground floor. The original student’s bedrooms on the 1st and 2nd floor are currently used as office space for charities and social businesses."

                "The painting, by Alfred U Soord dated 1914, depicts the crucifixion. The inner faces of the doors are decorated with coloured and gilt paint and show subjects from the Old Testament (to the left) and the symbols of the Evangelists (to the right). The paneling to the rear of the chapel is inscribed with names of the Fallen of the First World War. There are various plaques affixed to the paneling which commemorate the lives of people connected with Oxford House. The restoration of the original Chapel was completed in 1997 with further significant refurbishment in 2019 following water damage from the roof."
