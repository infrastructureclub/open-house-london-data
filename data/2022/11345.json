Our work brings people together through programmes of art and culture to create just futures, recognising the potential of art and culture to encourage imagination and cultivate exchange.",
                "Just futures can be realised when communities have the physical space and resources to proactively create their futures for themselves. Recognising the fact that some groups have been and continue to be under-served by enduring structures of power, our work centres these communities in the knowledge that their empowerment is crucial for the creation of a just world."
