A cavernous, dark, mysterious space, its creation allowed the artist to \"sculpt darkness\", encouraging the occupant to enter a different state of consciousness, to enjoy at the very least a meditative pause, a moment of withdrawal from the pulsating world outside.",
                "Gormley's ROOM is both a monumental figural sculpture and an architectural extension to the hotel. The interior, which is a dark fumed oak-clad bedroom in a one-bedroom suite, accessed up nine white marble steps through a black velvet curtain from a strongly contrasting pure white marble bathroom, is just as important as its exterior: a giant crouching cuboid figures based on the artist's body.",
                "Adjacent to ROOM, the bedroom, is a sitting room with large hallway and guest bathroom, decorated, like all the rooms in The Beaumont, in a soft Art Deco style with dark polished woods."
