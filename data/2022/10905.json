                "The existing buildings were stitched together with an extension built entirely from sustainable glue laminated timber (glulam) and cross laminated timber (CLT). These lightweight materials enable more floors to be added while significantly reducing the carbon footprint of the building.",
                "Sustainable design and construction",
                "At the outset, we chose to refurbish and extend this building rather than demolish and rebuild, avoiding the unnecessary demolition of a good building.",
                "Three new floors are constructed using the CLT and glulam timber structure, with the timber sourced from sustainably managed forests. This results in an average 43% reduction in carbon emissions, (see calculations below) compared to using a concrete or steel structure.",
                "In addition, by pre-fabricating the CLT elements off-site, construction traffic to the site was reduced by 70%.",
                "Carbon calculations",
                "Structural engineer Heyne Tillett Steel carried out detailed calculations to compare the embodied carbon associated with constructing the new extension using timber, steel or concrete.",
                "Glulam and CLT: 258,509 kg CO2",
                "Steel and metal deck: 493,843 kg CO2",
                "Reinforced concrete flat slab: 428,563 kg CO2",
                "The above calculations only take into account the building extension (floors 3, 4 and the roof) and do not include the additional benefits of lighter construction using timber, reducing the need for existing frame and foundation strengthening.",
                "The kg CO2 calculations are given at practical completion due to manufacture and transport. Sequestration, the carbon that will be ‘stored’ in the glulam and CLT was considered separately and was calculated as -408,134 kg CO2",
                "At practical completion, the glulam and CLT option reduced carbon emissions by approximately 48% compared to the steel structure and by approximately 40% versus the concrete structure – an average of which is calculated at 43%.",
