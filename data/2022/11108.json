A successor was built on the same site. That was burned down in 1821 and the rebuilt hall survived until it was destroyed by air attack in 1940. At the end of the War the Corporation of London carried out extensive re-planning and the Company lost much of its original mediaeval freehold by compulsory purchase orders. Nevertheless the present Hall - built in 1958 - still stands on part of the site of the first Saddlers’ Hall.",

                "The earliest surviving record that refers to a Guild of Saddlers in London dates from the second half of the 12th Century.  The saddlery craft flourished in London in the early Middle Ages. This was the period in which the artisan guilds contended with one another for economic power and influence and the Saddlers strove to control those crafts - such as the Joiners, Painters and Loriners - whose skills contributed to the products marketed by saddlers. Nonetheless by the 16th Century the economic balance had moved from the artisan companies to the merchant companies, which had acquired wealth and standing by trading in a wide range of goods. Thus when the Court of Aldermen, in 1515, set out the order of precedence of the livery companies in order of wealth rather than antiquity, the Saddlers were ranked 25th of the 42 companies then extant.  They remain 25th but there are now 110 livery companies in the City of London."

In 1995, on the 600th anniversary of the original Incorporation Charter, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II graciously granted her Supplemental Charter to the Saddlers' Company and it is that which now governs the Company's activities.",
