This redevelopment took over 30 years to complete, and South Acton eventually became one of the largest municipal housing estates in west London, with almost 2,100 homes.",
                "In 1999, a series of stand-alone schemes took place to address issues with specific blocks that were life expired, or suffering structural issues. In 2008, Ealing took the decision to comprehensively regenerate the area to achieve the transformation desired by residents."
