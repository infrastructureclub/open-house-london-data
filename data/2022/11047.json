New hand-crafted wooden screens have been created, complete with acid-etched and Brilliant cut glass, replicating one of the original wood and glass panels in the old saloon bar. This means the original seven bar layout has been restored.",
                "The highlight is the truly spectacular glazed skylight that spans what once would have been a billiards room, but is now an open kitchen, servery and dining area. Other quality fittings include the Victorian bar counters & bar backs (some have modern replacements); the big arch straddling the servery on the east side is original; a tiled lobby on the east side; attractive skylight over the former saloon on the east side; cast-iron columns and a good deal of etched glass."
