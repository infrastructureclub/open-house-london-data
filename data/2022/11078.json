                "The challenge was to design 1/2 a high street on a strip of land, only 4m wide and 100m long. The design brief was to create a meanwhile street that has a unique sense of place and authenticity within the local community and provides opportunity for activation and discovery throughout the day.",
                "The outcome is a contemporary reinterpretation of the high street which complements a carefully curated food and beverage offer that recently opened on the opposite retail parade. It’s playful and vibrant ‘jungle’ planting palette, full of tall palms, leafy grasses and winding climbers creates an immersive experience and green oasis against the urban jungle backdrop.",
                "The Meadow is an important pedestrian link which connects Elephant & Castle station to the centre of a new, mixed use development. It is a playful, meanwhile landscape which looks to provide a green oasis and shared sanctuary for people and pollinators within a dense urban environment.",
                "Designed to capture the imagination all ages, the space is brought to life through sculpture, natural play and places to rest. Site-felled timber and surplus soil was creatively re-used for natural play trails and tilted landforms. At night, the space is transformed by glowing light installations that mark the entrance to the park."
