                "The site was sub-divided into four deliverable parcels set around a modular grid using Premier’s standardised 12m by 3m modules. Built offsite in the UK, the building itself took just six weeks to construct once the modular components had arrived on the site, minimising disruption to the local area."

Each module uses lightweight steel frame boxes clad with insulation and at the end of its life, the building can be reused on-site, relocated in its entirety or stripped and the materials recycled, contributing to the circular economy.",
                "The modular approach to construction brought several important environmental benefits:",
                "•\tAs with all Premier buildings, the offsite structure was manufactured generating zero waste to landfill.",

                "Other environmental features include low energy LED lighting with PIR sensors, highly efficient heating and cooling using air source heat pumps and mechanical heat recovery, and Siberian larch cladding which can be re-used or recycled when the building is dismantled."

                "On campus, everything has been designed to be flexible; furniture is reused around the building to meet different requirements and student feedback is gathered to ensure their needs are met within the space.",
                "The building features a large double span exhibition, events, and cafeteria space, with a folding wall to divide the events space from the café when required. There are four large ‘makerspaces’ for practical learning, viewing galleries, smaller conference-style meeting and teaching rooms, a full-height glazed entrance, offices and student common room.",
                "One corner of the building was extended to three storeys to add visual interest and to create a large roof terrace for social interaction and with views over the Rotherhithe peninsula. Services in the ceiling are exposed to allow students to understand the complexities of the building as part of their learning experience."
