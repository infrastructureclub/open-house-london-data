                "The Isle of Dogs & South Poplar area is dramatically changing. It will see some of the densest and tallest residential development in the UK come forward over the next 15 years. The area has therefore been identified by Tower Hamlets Approach to Regeneration as one of the main areas in which change should be carefully managed to secure the delivery of social and environmental benefits for the local communities while growth happens.",
                "The DLR in the Isle of Dogs & South Poplar is an important piece of infrastructure not only as it keeps the area connected but also as the space under the tracks holds the potential to be developed as public open space, offering breathing space in the face of all incoming development. An improved space under the DLR would link the area at pedestrian level while activating it with new uses such as cultural events and social activities.",
                "In the face of the opportunities and challenges identified within the Isle of Dogs and South Poplar, plus the opportunity to activate the area post-COVID, the Council’s Regeneration Team has created the DLR Underline Activation project. The project aims to test how diverse, more creative uses can be hosted under the DLR, raising the profile of the site and setting a precedent for its potential longer-term activation, whilst helping to create a coherent vision for the space and celebrating the area and its people.",
                "The Underline Discovery Sessions are the first of series of temporary interventions to test the potential of the space to host more diverse uses. These will be a series of small events held as part of the Open House Festival 2021, exploring the site’s architecture, heritage and public realm.",
                "All events will be held on site and will provide opportunities for the public to explore the area through activities such as: contributing to the recording of a podcast about the area; responding to the site by writing poetry; highlighting what is of community value by sharing photographs online; capturing the built environment with sketches and drawings; joining a regeneration themed guided tour; walking along an historic audio trail; or just coming along to discuss the context of the project with some of the Borough’s officers."
