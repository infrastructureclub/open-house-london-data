The Guildhall Art Gallery also houses the famous painting 'The Defeat of the Floating Batteries at Gibraltar' by John Singleton Copley.",

Its collection now comprises 4,000 works of art from period views of historic London to the work of contemporary artists. Since the Second World War, the City of London’s collection has concentrated on London subjects."

The consistent Gothic feeling was nevertheless maintained by abstracted giant tracery, but the general powerful massing, achieved by consistent wall and roof planes, is perhaps more reminiscent of Lutyens. [It has a] sophisticated but most unusual design, neither modern nor postmodern ...”",
                "The project was begun in 1987 with an archeological investigation of the site, which unearthed medieval and Saxon remains and part of a Roman amphitheatre. The site was subsequently declared a scheduled ancient monument – with the result that Gilbert Scott had to design the new building around the remains, which are also on show to the public."

Focusing primarily on Victorian storytelling, visitors will learn about literary references which may have been commonly understood to the original audience, but which fell out of circulation for modern audiences.\nInspired! is open until 23 December. Entry to this exhibition is charged."
