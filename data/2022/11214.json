                "The weathered steel cladding is laid diagonally to give the simple stepped form texture and weight, and an industrial quality reminiscent of the original gasholders. It is constructed entirely from timber, with exposed beams and wooden ceilings imbuing the space with warmth and character. The top floor studio sits under the building’s sawtooth rooflights."

                "The solid timber floor slabs are exposed on the soffit, with a raised floor distributing services. The timber construction has resulted in a 41 per cent saving of kgC02/m² compared to an equivalent concrete structure. This construction has not only reduced embodied energy, but led to a more efficient prefabricated construction process that lowered the time on site.",
                "The building's walls are lined in a phase change material (PCM) board that contributes to the internal temperature control in hot weather, along with the external blinds and shutters. The distribution of windows and the shallow depth of the building ensure high levels of daylight and the ability to naturally ventilate the spaces. External shutters on its west side and fins on its east act to shield the upper floor windows from solar gain. The design was developed with M&E consultants Skelley & Couch, who thermally modelled the buildings to ensure the lightweight buildings perform as required."
