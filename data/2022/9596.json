                "Hackney Bridge is the third meanwhile project we have designed for Make Shift, following on from Pop Brixton and Peckham Levels. For many reasons, this was the most challenging of the three sites, but we had the learning and experience of the former to draw from. Meanwhile thinking focuses the mind and our approach is thus to try to do the most with the least; the least funds, materials, resources and time.",
                "Our Environmental Strategy built on this thought process of practicality. The challenge here was working within a highly controlled environment (from planning through to construction) that is the Olympic Park.\nWe set about an intensive period of research and local consultation, examining the workings of Hackney Wick located opposite our site, talking to artists, makers and creatives about the area and about how they worked and\nthe kind of space they might need in the future.\nThis resulted in five buildings with a range of uses and scales of space centred around one main public yard and the creation of direct access from the canal towpath through our site; a new open campus.\nThe three public-facing buildings are organised along the edge of an existing retaining wall and use a simple\nfactory roof profile to create a ‘quayside’ to the canal. The two workspace buildings sit between this new row and the existing Copper Box Arena.",
                "The buildings have been organised into heated and unheated spaces dependent on use. A careful balance had to be struck between the carbon embodied within say, insulation, and the carbon that would be saved only within a 12-year lifespan, and an argument made for offsetting. Every component of the building has been considered with these pressures in mind, and each building has been designed to be dismantled and either recycled or relocated (in whole or in part). We have five modest buildings here that can all have separate lives beyond.",
                "The five buildings forming Hackney Bridge share many similarities, but some key differences. The key similarity is the expressed steel frame that all five utilise. The three along the quayside have been connected together (as they are all public) via linking roofs, allowing people to walk between buildings without getting wet. They are also already offering space for pop-up stalls and bars at events. These three buildings share the same steel profiled cladding to create continuity, with each building differentiated through different window frame colours, proportions and disposition. The event space is a box within a box construction to provide acoustic isolation, the market hall is unheated and the block nearest the bridge is insulated and heated, with food and drink at ground floor and workspace above.\nThe black timber clad building houses maker spaces (which we think of as akin to railway arches in typology) at ground floor level, with co-work space above. The maker spaces have a fenced yard to the rear to allow deliveries and safe outdoor making. Plywood has been used extensively internally as a finish to add warmth and speed up construction (as opposed to dry lining).\nThe studio block is clad in a mixture of corrugated steel and polycarbonate panels. We reduced the use of polycarbonate due to life cycle concerns for the material. Internally we have used OSB3 and plywood left exposed, or where dry-lined left for tenants to complete.\nMaterials have generally been chosen as self-finished for speed, cost and durability. The concrete ground slabs, for instance, were polished and have been left exposed at ground floor level as the finish, reducing the need to add in further finishes."

                "We are extremely excited to officially open Hackney Bridge to the public, the third Make Shift project designed by Turner Works.\nInspired by the industrial heritage of the site (once home\nto the Clarnico sweet factory), the project aimed to offer workspace, public facilities, events, markets, restaurants and bars - giving local enterprises the space they need to make, create, trade and ultimately thrive together.\nWe tasked Turner Works to create a series of buildings\nthat echoed the industrial heritage of the area, creating a space that would be inviting for the whole community whilst showcasing our public facing members. It was also key to ensure that the project used appropriate materials and ef- ficient construction methods to reflect the project’s 12 year lifespan.\nTurner Works responded to the brief in their typical creative fashion by utilising the 6 months of community engage- ment work that Make Shift undertook prior to formulating the brief - translating this information into a development proposal that met the spatial needs of the local community and enhanced the profile of the area.\nNow that Hackney Bridge is officially open, a diverse and varied mix of enterprises are making the project their home. Local enterprise remains at the core, and we are proud that 40% of founding Members live within 1 mile of the site, with 84% from a neighbouring Growth Borough (Hackney, Tower Hamlets, Waltham Forest and Newham).\nAlongside our architects, the local community (including residents, community groups and neighbouring businesses) have been integral in shaping the project and will continue to do so throughout the lifespan of Hackney Bridge.\nJames Leay, Managing Director of Make Shift"
