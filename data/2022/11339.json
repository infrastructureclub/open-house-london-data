We were asked to significantly remodel the building to deliver an attractive, modern workplace, complete with improved floor to ceiling heights.",

                "Additionally, we have worked alongside landscape architect Tom Stuart-Smith to create a new garden immediately in front of the building where existing trees have been retained alongside new shrubs and understorey planting that will provide round-year interest and ground coverage to the redeveloped space. The garden had previously been a plain lawn with limited interest, but a considered redesign and new planting strategy will now provide seclusion and protection from the busy surrounding area, creating a more dynamic and varied space for the building’s users and passers-by ,to explore and move through.",
                "In the garden’s centre is a large, reflective pool designed in collaboration with water feature specialist Andrew Ewing. This reflects the sky and surrounding historic environment on its surface and serves as a light-well for basement space below."
