                "The Master Shipwright’s House and Office is one of the few remaining parts of Deptford’s former Royal Dockyard. Founded by Henry VIII in 1513 the King's Yard became one of the most important shipbuilding yards in the world before finally closing in 1869.",
                "The tudor house was rebuilt in 1708 for master shipwright Joseph Allin who, dissatisfied with his existing house, persuaded the Navy Board to invest in a remodelling. However, Allin overspent on the house and, amidst rumours of corruption,  he was dismissed in 1715.",
                "After the dockyards closed, the house was used by the superintendent of the Foreign Cattle Market that occupied the yards for a time.",
                "It was bought and repaired by its current owners in 1998. It functions as home, cultural centre and location for film and photography."

                "“Although the house is the part that is sticking out of the ground, what’s hidden is what’s really interesting for us,” says Chris. “Finding out this hidden history gives us an idea of what to repair, what to restore and what to manage.”",
                "They have recently uncovered the history of the adjoining office building, which was refashioned in 1805 by Samuel Bentham after his time working in Russia at the court of Catherine the Great.",
