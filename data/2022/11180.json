                "Catalyst are partners with Ealing Council in the regeneration of the Havelock Estate, and have built 289 new homes in the first phase.\nParts of the estate designated to be in the final phase of the masterplan were worst affected by issues such as fly-tipping, antisocial behaviour and rough sleeping. It was clear, during early engagement, that a meanwhile project would bring benefit to these areas and to the wider community in advance of the future regeneration.\nThe homes in this part of the estate back onto the Grand Union Canal so there was also an opportunity to improve connectivity to this valuable neighbourhood feature and create opportunities for play, sport, community use and recreation.\nA feasibility report was commisioned which identified a total of 36 garages and 2000 sqm of space, as underutilised and having the potential to provide facilities and amenity to support the community. This has formed the Open Havelock project area.\nThe ambition of the project is to:\n• Support and strengthen the Havelock community\n• Establish a community facility that brings play, sport, enterprise, and recreational benefit to local people\n• Embed learning and outcomes from the project into the longer-term plans for Havelock\n• Transform blighted parts of the estate into spaces that are social and delightful.’",
                "The project is underpinned by in-depth engagement with the local community. During the feasibility stage, a ‘listening project’ formed a rich portrait of people’s perceptions and aspirations. Long form transcribed interviews, vox pops and podcasts produced by children from Havelock Primary school were conducted as part of the study.\nThe analysis identified many potential partners and programmes including sports, skill development, play, entrepreneurship, catering, music, and many others. Potential partners helped to co-design the detailed designs and operational plan.\nCovid among other factors has impacted on the operating environment since the project started. A review of the project in Summer 2021 tested the assumptions made at feasibility stage and re-evaluated potential uses for the site."

Toy library\nstorage for play materials and learning\nresources is installed along the back walls.

The project aims to improve the\nconnectivity between the estate and the\ntowpath by carrying out landscape and access\nimprovements. Garages have been fitted with\nnew roller shutter doors to provide secure \nspace to store leisure equipment and items \nthat facilitate physical activity.
