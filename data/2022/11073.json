Together, we tested several options to arrive at the optimal depth. The generous setback creates an intimate courtyard at kitchen level and comfortable access to the steps climbing up the garden. The extension is finished in dark grey bricks with dark mortar and crowned with a rooflight box clad in charred wood planks. The black construction declares itself against the white-rendered ground floor finish. To increase the feeling of openness and brightness, the side extension is almost entirely glazed with a new pivot door to the garden and a huge roof light that both fit into the rooms' geometric composition."

                "By extending the kitchen and dining area into the side garden, we created new access to the rear of the house through the former rear sitting room window. The newly freed space in the middle of the house is transformed into a service area with a small WC, coat storage and access to the cellar. The compact kitchen and dining take advantage of every centimetre space through bespoke joinery and seating furniture that we designed with the clients and ordered from Italy. The front sitting room is opened to create a larger space, with more direct access to the entrance, improved insulation and windows, and new finishes. From an interior design point of view, we had lots of fun interpreting and redesigning the clients' references which ranged from classical Victorian to early 20th century Bauhaus and a lot later Art Deco influences. The front sitting rooms maintain a classical taste, with herringbone parquet flooring and muted decoration: a very subtle grey band replaces skirting boards and cornices, resulting in a lighter feeling. Instead, the kitchen and dining room are an explosion of colour and geometry with black and white joinery, multicoloured floor, and coloured walls. The strong geometry of the composition refers to both Bauhaus and the Art Deco examples we discussed with the clients."
