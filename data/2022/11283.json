                "Mizzi Studio was commissioned by artisan brand Colicci to design a unique café for the main entrance of Westfield Stratford shopping centre, leading from the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. The café embodies Colicci’s affinity for the organic and its undulant form blurs boundaries between architecture and public sculpture.",
                "With this project, we set out to push the boundaries of sculptural form and material manipulation. Its tour-de-force is a swelling copper roof, which seemingly floats above the glazed pavilion below. Its surface is made using a combination of an 18th century sheathing technique and computer-aided design."

                "The café’s innovative design was a direct response to the client’s desire for a revolutionary structure that would transform the conventions of kiosk design. Aside from the grand sculptural gesture provided by the copper roof, the café is designed with maximum glazed openability, offering warm protection from all weather conditions in an outdoor setting. Its transparency allows shoppers to glance into the kiosk’s paired-back, contemporary interiors, which provide a visual respite to the surrounding fastpace environment.",
                "Mizzi Studio developed a digital skin, then divided its surface area into virtual tile segments that translated to laser-cut sheets. The result is a bespoke jigsaw of 542 copper pieces that were assembled by hand with a pneumatic gun and 20,000 rivets. Patinated finger prints and hammer marks were left to give an earthy texture.",
                "Designed to mimic the mouth of an orchid, the captivating\nentrance and roof is shaped to lure visitors in to an immersive copper cocoon – converting the grab-and-go culture into a sensory, fun, and warm user experience. The copper has been sealed with a matte, clear lacquer to preserve the material’s textural history, and retain its rich lustre and reflectivity.",
                "The combination of the kiosk’s neo-futuristic form, deep amber hues,and polished surfaces results in a functioning café that also acts as a piece of dramatic public sculpture.",
                "“The Copper Coffee House is a great example of what Mizzi Studio can bring to the restaurant, bar and hospitality industry. We are so excited,and feel so privileged, to be able to continue creating designs that inspire people and change conventions in architecture.\"\nJonathan Mizzi – Director, Mizzi Studio"
