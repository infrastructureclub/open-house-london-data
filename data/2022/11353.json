                "A key part of this is reopening the dock to the Lea's tidal waters so it can be used for moorings, this requires the removal of a dam and the introduction of an opening foot bridge. This new foot bridge will carry the 'Leaway' footpath and cycle route and also 'The Line' Sculpture walk.",

                "Originally built in 1871, Cody Dock was constructed by the Imperial Chemical Company for the purpose of unloading coal from barges that was used to produce coal gas (town gas) and distribute the factory’s many by-products, such as soap and the pigment Prussian Blue. The dock was later purchased by the Gaslight and Coke Company who also owned the Beckton gasworks which became the largest gasworks in Europe. \nAfter being taken over by British Gas, the dock and its associated factory buildings fell into decline from the late 1960’s with all production coming to a close in the early 1980’s. Cody Dock and the surrounding properties were taken over by the Docklands Development Corporation in the early 90’s and much of the surrounding land was parcelled off for redevelopment into the business parks that still remain today. The dock, however, was no longer seen as being viable and was blocked off, partially filled in and converted into a balancing lagoon for surface water run-off. \nIn November 2009 the charity Gasworks Dock Partnership was formed by local residents as a not-for-profit organisation, to provide a community led regeneration vehicle with the aim of opening up public access to the Lower Lea River and restoring the dock."

With support from Thames Water, the Veola Environmental Trust, Kew Gardens, the Royal Horticultural Society, Newham Council and the Big Lottery, Cody Dock has established itself as a flagship vehicle for community-led regeneration.\nWith Phase One complete and the Leaway River Lea Park now kick started, Cody Dock is already home to a number of creative industries, social enterprises and visitor attractions, that include:\n•\tDocklands Community Boat\n•\tCody Dock Cafe\n•\tGallery and exhibition space\n•\tOutdoor classroom\n•\tStudio spaces\nIn April 2018, GDP successfully gained planning permission for the seven year development plan of its 2.5 acre site into a creative industries quarter. This will include:\nNew visitor centre & café\nExhibition space\nSocial and Industrial heritage archive and pavilion\nInternational artist and respite hosting suites\n10 new studios and workshop spaces\n10 new live/work moorings\nVisitor moorings\nDry dock facilities"

                "As a part of the big vision to regenerate and restore Cody Dock, Gasworks Dock Partnership had applied for and been granted planning permission for an opening foot bridge at the neck of the dock. This original plan involved an off-the-shelf product opening bascule-type bridge sourced from the Netherlands.",
                "Designer Thomas Randall Page got wind of these plans and approached GDP to see if he could counter propose something more unique. He suggested that the bridge was an important centrepiece for the whole project, the keeper of two thresholds, bank to bank and also river to dock. As such this infrastructure should be celebrated and memorable, something people would come and see not cross and forget.",
                "Thomas then went on a slow 2 week journey on a canal boat and spent his time sketching only stopping to help with the locks. He returned with an idea for a new type of opening bridge and took it to Tim Lucas a fantastic structural engineer at Price & Myers to pass an eye over it and see if it “had legs”. Tim loved the idea and with the help of a model Thomas pitched it to Simon Myers at GDP.",
                "Simon was taken enough with the idea that he changed tack and the rest is history."

                "Seeing the potential for public spectacle inherent in the opening of a bridge, I set about adding to this list of motions.",
                "Rolling parallel to the channel it crosses, this unique bridge design owes much to its Victorian forbears. They knew that moving large heavy structures efficiently requires that they are balanced system and my design works on this principle.",
                "Square toothed portals at each end of the span roll on undulating rails attached to the brick abutments. Counterweights at the top of each portal balance the bridge deck that connects them. This symmetry allows the whole bridge structure to smoothly role through 180 degrees to a fully inverted position facilitating the passage of boats back and forth from the river to the dock. So finely balanced is this system that it requires no motors or electricity and can be operated manually much like a canal lock.",
                "Constructed from weathering steel and oak, the bridge design aims to be understated in its rest position but celebratory and playful in its movement creating a spectator and memorable event when operated. Part of an ambitious footpath and cycleway project to run the full length of the Lea River, we hope this rolling bridge will become an important landmark and a symbol of the dynamic creative community which is growing here.",
