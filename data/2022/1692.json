New writing is particularly encouraged as are aspiring directors. There are plenty of roles behind the scenes and help and encouragement is given to new members, who are always welcome. SLT has a basement bar for members which is open for all performances and hosts regular social events.",

                "The Gothic revival style building was originally a fire station, built in 1881 by the Metropolitan Board of Works and probably designed by their architect Richard Pearsall.It is the only surviving fire station for horse drawn tenders which still has its watch tower and central double doors in place. The three storeys above the ground floor served as accommodation for the officers and their families.",
                "The Old Fire Station ceased to be operational in 1916 due to it being too small for the motorised fire engines which were then being introduced. It subsequently became the church hall for the neighbouring parish church of St Luke and retained this function until the 1960s. During this period, in 1927, the ground floor of the building was extended to cover what had been the rear courtyard and stables.",
                "By 1967, the building became home to two local amateur drama groups who had combined to seek a permanent venue. The design for the conversion of the building to a theatre was by Owen Luder (later to become President of the Royal Institute of British Architects on two occasions). The area behind the distinctive red doors, where the appliances and horses had originally been kept, became the stage of the 100 seater Bell Theatre. An additional studio space with flexible seating, was added in 1976, the same year that the original parts of the building gained Grade II listed status."

A grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund was approved in July 2014 and work started in September 2016. The renovation was carried out by Thomas Ford and Partners. In the meantime, SLT moved temporarily to Stanley Halls, South Norwood and performed there from November 2015 to April 2018.",
                "The first performance at the newly renovated building, now renamed the Old Fire Station, took place in March 2018. There is now only one (larger) performance space, but it has greater seating capacity, is fully flexible (in fact the first few shows had completely different seating/acting area arrangements) and is higher so stage lighting is improved. There is room to build another auditorium when funds permit, but extra rehearsal space has enabled us to return to 2 shows a month. The building is now far more accessible including a lift.",
                "The main move back was in April 2018, with the first production in the new space in the following week, though the Youth Group had performed in the new theatre space in March.",
                "We have published a history of the building, The Old Fire Station Book, which is available online or at the theatre."
