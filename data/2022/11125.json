Originally designed as a private members club by Frederick Gould and Giles Gilbert Scott, designer of the iconic British red telephone box and architect of Bankside Power Station now the Tate Modern, The Gilbert has been returned to its former glory.",
                "Close attention has been paid to the unique and original features of this magnificent heritage building. The Gilbert brings out the distinctive, characterful – surprising – nature of the original building, and introduces new standards of daylight, exterior spaces and clean air via natural ventilation from opening windows and sustainability."

                "How this was achieved: \n1. Embodied Carbon: The retention of 90% of the original structure resulted in major carbon savings- 9,500 tonnes less than LETI Office Benchmark. \n2. Operational Energy: The Gilbert’s energy saving measures resulted in an estimated consumption of 87.3 kWhe/m2.- 3% lower than the UKGBC benchmark for Net Zero Carbon pathway.\n3. Offsetting: Once due diligence was complete to account for all possible avenues for reduction of embodied carbon, 3100 tonnes of residual carbon emissions were offset with the purchase of the Fresh Breeze Project in Mexico.",
                "The renovation of The Gilbert created less than 20% of the embedded CO2 emissions compared to a new building and achieves a comparable energy efficiency.",
                "The impact of choosing office space in the Gilbert corresponds to avoiding immediately around 9,000 kgCO2e* per workplace. That’s equivalent to stopping using your car for 4.5 years, avoiding flying from London to New York 29 times or planting 450 trees!"
