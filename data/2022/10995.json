The siting of the CSC+L was carefully considered as the catalyst for a host of new routes and interlinked public spaces across the campus. The building knits together the wider site by emphasising the relationship between the Civic Campus and Town Centre."

The plan form in turn, responds to existing trees, adjacent streets, building lines, and vistas, and takes a particular interest in the way facades turn corners and windows framing key views.",
                "Large floor plates with clear sightlines are punctuated by a central void that shifts upwards, with spectacular views of the sky through a top-lit roof light. Full height windows to maximise the natural light deep into the plan, and maintaining strong visual connections to the surrounding context are key aspects of the design."
