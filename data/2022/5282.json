                "Levitt Bernstein is an award-winning practice of architects, landscape architects and urban designers. They have occupied their new home at Finsbury Park since the summer of 2018.",
                "The team designed their new studio to sit within the shell of a light industrial building, a laundry built around 1915. The intention was to create a free-flowing space that reflects their collaborative nature – there is an emphasis on breakout and informal meeting spaces.",
                "It is a robust ‘found’ space, with good levels of natural daylight. The main studio space has a polished concrete floor and a mezzanine hangs centrally within it which is nestled amongst the original wooden rafters. The furniture is all light plywood, contributing to the overall airy feeling.",
                "The studio is naturally ventilated with automatically opening rooflights, with shading to prevent excessive solar grain. The concrete floor and exposed brick walls provide the thermal mass that helps moderate the internal environment.",
                "Phase 2 of the works completed in mid-2021 and create a new foyer at the front of the building with additional meeting space and a new landscaped forecourt.",
                "They will have a variety of architectural models and other work on display on the day, and visitors will be able to take a tour of the studio as well as receive an illustrated walking tour map which will highlight local landmarks.",
                "Friends at Goodgym Islington, a volunteering initiative, will also be leading a 5km run through their community projects in the neighbourhood starting from the studio at 3pm."
