                "The rear extension for a new kitchen and dining area is integrated in the landscaping of the west facing garden in South-West London. The fan-shaped roof modulates the solid and light parts of the new addition leading into the external spaces and bringing light back into the existing building. The rhythm of the timber framed roof structure is followed through into the detail of the kitchen fittings, desk and shelving elements. The brick envelope is articulated as a generous bay window with patterned brickwork to accommodate the dining area. Steel windows with slender sightlines frame the views out into rear and courtyard garden. Internally the walls are finished with clay that complements the vertical timber fins and the natural palette of materials throughout.",
                "Warm tones and rich textures meet clean lines and industrial finishes creating a unique ambience varying with the changing light in the course of the day and the seasons.",
                "The external finishes are brought to life with dry garden planting interspersed with gravel between the concrete pavers. A generous planter and climbing frames create thresholds between inside and outside.",
                "At the heart of this residential extension project was a vision to bring living and working together and to transform the external space into a terraced garden with varied planting and seating. Close collaboration with the client shaped the design throughout all stages and was vital in bringing the project to live. The flourishing garden is testament to this fruitful dialogue."
