                "The listing of Brixton Rec in 2016 (Grade II status) was in part due to its role as social condenser, the way that it spatially brought together sport, culture and social spaces, a place for all ages, a place of gathering."

The Rec has also become particularly important as a post-Windrush heritage site and is emblematic of Brixton’s diverse post-war community. It carries considerable communal and historical value derived largely from intangibles such as the diverse user groups (local sports teams, sound systems events, activist meetings)"

                "The building is thoughtfully composed and proportioned, intricately planned around a top-lit circulation space with long views through the building. The monolithic brick masses are brought to a human scale at street level with sculptural concrete forms.",
                "The special interest of the interior of the Rec is concentrated on the circulation atrium and the dramatic swimming pool hall.",
                "In Finch’s own words: \"The main concept of Brixton Recreation Centre was the central atrium.\"",
                "“The circulation atrium provides access to all activity areas… and its glass roof allows thorough penetration of natural light and forms a spacious, open heart to the building. It is this space that exemplifies Finch’s ambition that the centre should encourage human interaction, provide opportunities for spectating, and thus encourage visitors to take part in more activities. It is a visually exciting and dynamic space which is further enlivened by the bustle of activity.\"",
                "Its simple palette of materials is deployed three-dimensionally to maximise daylight and to make visual connections. “The materials of the exterior continue within: the deeply coffered ceilings, coarse red brick and concrete, complement additional smoother materials such as the tiles and matchboarding used on floors and areas of the walls. A sleek, wide, stainless steel handrail lines the atrium void and stairs, catching the light and highlighting its divergent form. There is a robustness to the detailing and a clear commitment to using good-quality materials throughout. »"
