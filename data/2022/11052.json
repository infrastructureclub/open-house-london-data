                "75 Grosvenor Street’s re-design and construction was carried out over three years and completed at the end of 2021. Following a technically challenging project of re-construction, extension, conservation, and restoration, the space integrates two properties made up of numerous distinct buildings of different dates to create a single, coherent, Mayfair office building.\n \nThe raw material at the start included two highly damaged and altered Grade II listed houses dating to 1724, and the retained façade of Wimperis and Simpson’s 1917 reconstruction of a third house from the original Grosvenor Estate development. Behind these heritage assets, whose hidden value was yet to be realised, a confusion of concrete and steel framed extensions existed on multiple levels with limited interconnection.\n \nIn need of a total reconfiguration, developer W.RE and architects Cowie Montgomery set to work to bring the buildings back to life through a sensitive restoration. Columns were removed, transfer beams inserted, floor levels adjusted, and additional stories added to weave together the buildings that make up 75 Grosvenor Street as it stands today."

                "75 Grosvenor Street combines its retained eighteenth-century townhouse facades with creative and elegant modern architecture, including the £1 million feature helical staircase lying at the heart of the building.\n \nClues to the buildings’ past can be found throughout the historic and modern spaces, from previously undiscovered eighteenth-century portraits that provide a glimpse into the lives of the Georgian townhouses’ former residents, to the atrium’s interlayered silk glass panels that recall the Devy family of Royal couturiers and silk merchants who lived and traded here in the nineteenth century.\n \nA new limestone floor at street entrance unites the historic common areas with modern architecture through a bespoke motif, representative of the crests of eighteenth and nineteenth century livery companies. You can spot this motif throughout 75 Grosvenor Street – on the wallpaper printed for the washrooms, air grilles, façade metalwork, and internal balustrades – weaving a thread to the past throughout the building."
