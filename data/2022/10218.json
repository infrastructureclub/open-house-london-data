The main volume, standing on archetypally 1960s Staffordshire blue engineering brick, shows the influence of Mies van der Rohe in its simplicity and structural clarity, but it is excitingly interrupted by a cuboid of channelled and bush-hammered concrete, colliding with it like volumes in a Paul Klee painting.\"",
                "\"Bold in its detailing, the volume of the library is neighbourly and respectful to the surrounding buildings. The beautiful original typography of the ‘LIBRARY’ sign survives in good condition.\" The original plans also show 'LIBRARY' on the front elevation made from concrete, too, but the architect apparently changed their mind during the project and commissioned the metal sign in what is thought to be a variation of a generic compressed Grotesk.",
                "\"Inside, the floating concrete volume turns out to house an intimate and cosy children’s library lit by a clerestory, whilst the abundant natural light and views available on its corner site reach readers in the main library through tall windows with a taste of the civic pride and optimism of its period.\" \nThis part of the library used to be the reading room with modern leather chairs and reading tables, providing the library's visitors with a calm, private space with the clerestory providing ample light for reading. The children's library used to be on the lower-level mezzanine adjacent to the reception area.",
                "\"The minimalist elegance of the interior design survives unusually well, with original wallpaper and handrails, and the structure of the building unaltered.\"",
                "By the 1960s a rebuilding of the library from the late 19th century original was required. This provided 65% additional floor space compared to the existing library by changing the layout to a split-level arrangement and by adopting a flat roof.",
                "\"The interior is split into three main sections: reception, 1st floor library and second floor library.  There is also a basement level mezzanine and study gallery at the top level. The additional study mezzanine at the top floor adds an extra bank of windows to the 1st floor library creating a seemingly much larger space.\"",

This building was sadly demolished in 2015. \nAdditionally, Lea planned South Norwood Leisure Centre on Portland Road. This building housing a swimming bath was refurbished with cladding added in 2006. The original structure is still visible from the outside and an original staircase inside remains in place."

                "The site has been home to a library since 1897, but Croydon Borough architect Hugh Lea designed this purpose-built library building consulting with Croydon's Chief Librarian T. E. Callander F.L.A. and the library team to inform the design and layout.",
                "The aim in the design was to allow residents easy access to books and daily newspapers; alongside school children who  would also enjoy a quiet , well-lit spacious area to read and study. In more recent decades the building was adapted to provide access to wi-fi and as a centre for community group activity.",
                "The five level open structure has been recognised as unique in its architectural character and this contributed to the library becoming a locally listed building within the South Norwood Conservation Area.",
                "The community take great pride in this civic building, which has become a central landmark of SE25. In 2006 the participatory arts organisation ‘Mosaic Art’ worked with local schoolchildren and the local community to design and construct a mosaic which would form a permanent art installation on the library forecourt. The project brought together a variety of cultures and backgrounds to create a pictorial record of past and present experiences. Passers-by can enjoy the heritage treasure map which contains many clues about the history of the area."
