                "St Peter & St Paul's was mostly built in the twelfth century and is mentioned in the Domesday Book. The Chancel was rebuilt in the fourteenth century and the tower built in the fifteenth. The porch was added during the next century. The most recent additions are the North Aisle (1880) and the new Choir Vestry (1966).",
                "The Church is surrounded by a mature churchyard whose most notable and venerable feature is a yew tree, thought to be over one thousand years old and probably the oldest in the country.",
                "The interior of the church boasts an oak panelled Baptistry which contains a simple Baptismal Font of Purbeck marble. Dating from about 1190 AD it has a stepped base, the bowl being supported by four round pillars.",
                "The superb stained glass windows range from a much restored Romanesque window depicting the Annunciation, through the Nativity, Epiphany and the presentation of Christ in the Temple to the magnificent East Window which depicts the Crucifixion of Christ.",
                "The church also contains an Easter Sepulchre, which was used symbolically during the pre-Reformation Holy Week observances, and is one of the few to survive the upheavals of the 16th and 17th centuries.",
                "Much of the Church's character derives from the furnishings and monuments given in memory of the regular worshipping congregation. They are numerous, but for the visitor who may care to come and visit the church and read the dedications, they bear witness to over nine hundred years of Christian worship."
