The church was built by private subscription without endowments, and with the extra gift of a fresco by Sir Edward Poynter.",
                "Despite enormous damage sustained during the blitz, St Stephen’s church managed to survive, and in the early 1990s was reordered and refurbished to provide a worship space more suited for the times, but in keeping with the architecture of the building.",
                "In 1999 a new church hall was built to replace that built as a “temporary” structure in 1947. St Stephen’s now has a church and hall well suited as a base for its outreach and other activities along with a new resource for the local community."

                "Designed by Charles Barry Jr (the son of the architect of the Houses of Parliament), the Church was of considerable beauty and was richly decorated in the Victorian Gothic style beloved of Pugin and Ruskin, as can be seen from a contemporary painting, probably the work of Barry himself.",
                "The Church met the needs of the growing community south of the newly-built Dulwich College (also designed by Barry) and Dulwich Woods became the setting for many fine houses.  Shortly after the completion of the building Sir Edward Poynter executed the fine fresco in the chancel commemorating the Trial and Martyrdom of St Stephen."

                "Despite serious war damage caused by V1 ‘flying bombs’ in 1944, the building was saved, though not without anxious moments in 1946 when the walls began to lean outwards. This was the result of the pressure exerted on them by the roof which had almost been lifted off the building by the bomb blast.",

This  work was described in The Builder magazine as a ‘miracle’.",
