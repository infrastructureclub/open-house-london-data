                "The Chinese Garage is a motor garage and former petrol station situated in Beckenham in the London Borough of Bromley, not far from Kelsey Park. Built in 1928 and designed by Edmund B. Clarke, the building is actually in the style of a Japanese pagoda. It was the winner of a Better Petrol Stations competition organised by the Daily Express and the Gardeners Guild in the 1930s.",
                "Although the building has long been referred to as the Chinese Garage, the name was not actually registered until 1989; prior to this, its official name was Langley Park Garage. It is now a Grade II listed building, and in 2001 was voted the most unusual garage in England. The building is now part of a car dealership and is no longer a petrol garage."
