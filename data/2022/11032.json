                "Converted from a Victorian perfume works, DSDHA’s studio is set within an oasis-like urban yard in Vauxhall. The building is accessed down a narrow alley off Kennington Lane and near the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, in the heart of this vibrant area. We chose to be here because of our longstanding connections with the local community, having worked on the design for the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens.",
                "As socially minded designers, our approach to converting our new studio was informed by the desire to nurture creativity and wellbeing in a setting that celebrates the 'as found' qualities of the existing building, along with expressing our ethos of making the most from least, with maximum benefit.",
                "A large gathering space greets visitors at the entrance, which contains the library, kitchen and social area. This is the heart of the studio’s day-to-day life, where we take turns cooking for each other once a week. Our yard offers outside tables and chairs, planters for the gardening club and space for samples, testing and our model shop.",
                "Going back to our roots as a studio founded in a shared mews, we also have outdoor toilets, located in the yard. This was a deliberate choice allowing us to take a break from work, to get away from computer screens to be stimulated by nature.",
                "As one moves up the building every floor is filled with drawings, models, and samples. Industrial remnants of the Victorian building, such as pulleys and hoists have been kept, whilst new light fittings and furniture specially designed by the practice have been added."
