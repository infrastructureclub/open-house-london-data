                "Winner of a RIBA London award in 2019 and shortlisted for House of the Year and the Stephen Lawrence Prize, the project is conceived as a series of carefully articulated rooms connected by a sculptural top lit staircase and oblique views.",
                "Formerly a domestic car garage, the site for the Pocket House presented the practice with a series of demanding design constraints.  In addition to the site's limited footprint of just over 80 sqm, there were various planning and daylighting constraints relating to neighbouring gardens and existing building lines. The challenge for us as architects was to deliver a family home in a way which would not feel compromised by the sites limitations and which would have an atmosphere with more gravity than the modest footprint might suggest.",
                "Through an iterative design process the plan was unlocked by placing the more private spaces of the bedrooms below ground and orientating them around a sunken courtyard.  A timber ‘pod’ placed in the darkest corner of this floor contains a family bathroom. The kitchen and dining areas are located at ground level and are separated from the entrance sequence to the house by another timber pod element.  This element hides pragmatic functions, such as a WC, coat cupboard and kitchen storage.  An open plan living space sits on the first floor with street views obliquely concealed behind a timber screen.",
                "To further maximise space large doors fold back into niches, eliminating corridors and creating flow between rooms to make the entire plan active.  Sightlines throughout the house are carefully curated to blur internal and external boundaries and generous skylights with exposed structure help to create volume, depth and visual interest in section."
