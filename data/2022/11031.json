                "The locally listed, Edwardian corner site and remodelled residential terraces opened as Wards Department Store in 1901. The shop was highly renowned as one of the grand stores of its day and forms a strong part of Tottenham’s history and identity. It served the local community at Seven Sisters until it closed in 1972 - not long after the opening of the Victoria line created a fast and efficient connection into the centre of London."

                "The struggle to save Seven Sisters Indoor Market from demolition has been a long battle. It began over 15 years ago when the Wards Corner site was targeted for redevelopment. Our struggle has taken many forms: from salsa to human chains, event fundraisers, crowdfunding campaigns, marches, demonstrations and legal battles. Its longevity and strength is a result of the ongoing, relentless and dedicated efforts of traders, residents, volunteers and activists who have led and supported the campaign over the years.Following extensive community engagement and significant volunteer efforts, a Community Plan to re-develop the building  was granted planning permission in April 2014. It reflected and built upon the style of the current market which has evolved over the years to suit the multi-generational, multi-cultural and multi-purpose nature of the space."

                "The development of the Community Plan has been an iterative process, initiated in 2007 and informed by around 15 years of campaigning. The Plan emerged from a strongly and widely held desire to retain and enhance Seven Sisters Market and the surrounding small independent businesses that serve low-income and diverse ethnic and migrant communities.",
                "The fourth iteration of the plan, co-designed by the architectural cooperative Unit 38, will sustainably restore the existing buildings and provide 3122.3sqm of retail/cafe space with an enhanced market at its heart, alongside 650sqm of affordable workspaces and new community facilities. On the wider site, there is the potential for social housing development in collaboration with the council and the community.",
                "The community plan received planning permission in 2014 and again in 2019, when it received hundreds of letters of support. After years of objection to build-to-rent Grainger Plc's redevelopment scheme, August 2021 marked their withdrawal from the site. Subsequent to this, Haringey Council issued a statement in support of the community plan.",
