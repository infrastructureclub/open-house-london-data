It has been combined into one building, imaginatively combining existing facades with new-build elements, and characterised by varying facade treatments, setbacks and terraces. This technique fragments the block externally into a seemingly smaller scale while still retaining deep, flexible floorplans, meeting the brief for a large-scale office. The building incorporates social spaces such as a café, roof terraces, bar and publicly accessible park."
