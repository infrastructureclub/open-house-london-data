                "This new meeting house was completed in 2020, but no sooner did it open than it had to shut down due to the pandemic. However, the building is now open for worship and visitors.",
                "The congregation decided at the beginning of planning this new building, that it should speak to Quaker values by reflecting the testimony to simplicity, using natural materials where possible which have been ethically sourced.",
                "The entrance is designed to welcome the community to a peaceful, calm, light-filled building. Quakers is a non-hierarchical organisation and the belief in the equality of all beings is reflected in the airy, circular meeting room whose windows look out on both sky and, in season, a wildflower mini meadow. Triple-glazed windows and double-glazed doors,\nnot only facilitate the certified sustainable environmental system, but also enable our silent worship.",
                "Quaker testimony to sustainability was a priority when architect Steward Dodd was chosen out of a field of 126 other candidates, as he shared not only the congregation's vision, but also had the necessary environmental credentials. Consequently, the meeting house is Association for Environment Conscious Building (AECB) certified (‘Passivhaus’ standards of energy efficiency).",
                "The wood used throughout- larch, oak and beech - is Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified, and all carpentry demonstrates Shaker-like craftsmanship. The brick stock blends seamlessly with nearby houses, while the latticing and patterning manifest the beauty of that material. In recognition of the excellence of our design and outstanding environmental building standards, The Hammersmith Society awarded us its 2021 Environmental Award.",
                "This building is on one floor and is fully accessible for wheelchairs and buggies."
