                "The London Screen Academy is a unique learning environment in a heritage building transformed from a disused radio and television factory into a world class specialist sixth form education facility.",
                "The project includes a 300-seat theatre and lecture space at the heart of the building along with specialist teaching classrooms. The team worked hard to protect and preserve the historic fabric of the building whilst incorporating modern interventions in line with a ‘long life, loose fit’ ethos to ensure that it is suitable for current and future uses. The facilities are also available for public use outside of school hours.",
                "Through preserving the heritage façade, lessening the impact on the local area by keeping the location’s historic grain intact, this place was nurtured through the dramatic internal reconfiguration needed to make the building not only work for the LSA, but also an industry-leading headquarters for a new cultural institution.",
                "The large windows of the primary façades fronting the conservation area were the perfect asset - allowing expansive outlook and natural daylight to all the classrooms. Replacing these with a suitable heritage alternative was paramount to ensure the product would meet the required technical specifications as well as being aesthetically suitable for the conservation area. The resulting selection was one of the most significant design decisions to the external façade, greatly enhancing the appearance of the building within the community.",
                "By stripping back the internal frame of the building, and reworking the multi-storey industrial space - replaced with a three-storey professional film production studio and supporting facilities such as hair and makeup rooms and sound labs - spaces were created which will grow with the ambition of this place, surrounded by teaching and workshop facilities which are truly versatile and flexible.",
                "Taking the inside out, we created a whole new rooftop courtyard, to film screenings, to play host to informal gatherings and events as a flexible social space and allow views over London.",
                "In 2020, London Screen Academy was awarded with the Refurbishment of the Year at the Education Estate Awards. This award recognises either a school, college, or university refurbishment project that has made a difference to the educational or research experience."
