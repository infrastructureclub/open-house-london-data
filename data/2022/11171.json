                "Meta’s office at 11-21 Canal Reach is the largest and most significant office development to date for King’s Cross Central Limited Partnership. Designed by Bennetts Associates, the contemporary building with a BREEAM Outstanding rating provides over 400,000 sq ft of modern office space with the interiors concept designed by Gehry Partners and developed and delivered by TP Bennett. With flexible floorplates and outstanding views, it is the largest of the tech company's five offices in London.\nThe development is divided into four large facets that follow the curve of the site and is topped with an expansive 4,000m² rooftop garden by LDA design offering a biodiverse space to enhance wellbeing for employees. During the early project stages, Meta and the design team worked collaboratively with the landlord and their design team to make bold interventions to the base building.\nThe building is heavily influenced by the industrial heritage of the extensive railway development on its western boundary. Its distinctive façade features two layers: a cladding of bronzed anodised aluminium panels sits behind bronze anodised aluminium louvres that are perforated. Together, they reflect the building’s scale and emphasise the curved perspectives along Canal Reach in both distant and near views."

As well as extensive outdoor terraces, internal spaces have been designed to maximise natural light. Designed as a building with a defined base, middle and crown, the upper floors of the building are set back from the lower section to reduce the overall mass of the building, respect contextual relationships and create a series of generous planted terraces with outstanding views at the building’s fifth floor.\nA deep façade of honed, pre-cast concrete elements creates an elevational grid directly influenced by key geometries of the surrounding context. \nInternally, a steel frame supports pre-cast floor slabs that create visual continuity with the external pre-cast concrete ledges. Large floorplates of generous height create flexible working environments and are connected by characterful common parts that are defined through a strategic use of robust linings and exposed concrete elements."
