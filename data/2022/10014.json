                "Theatrum Mundi is pleased to announce a new book to be published by Theatrum Mundi Editions on 20 September 2022 – Site Report by Glasgow-based artist and poet Rhona Warwick Paterson.",
                "Developed and written during Rhona’s fellowship at Theatrum Mundi (2020-22), Site Report is an imaginative re-worlding of domestic space that destabilises the most intimate and familiar of spaces, proposing a pulsating landscape with uncontained possibility. Historical perceptions of the domestic are synonymous with the drudgery of home-making and house-keeping, and these days also home-working and home-schooling: a gendered space out of sight. Yet, within the conditions of the poet’s mind during lockdown, the four walls of the home – the domain of the mundane and the tame – can become a test-site for wild reimagining of alternative realities, breathing life into the inanimate and setting them loose.",
                "Site Report is a collection of poetry in prose, verse and screenplay, where windows are a lot more than panes of glass, tables have minds of their own and sinks are conduits that connect to the wider world beyond the home. It is not a book about the domestic: it is the domestic reimagined. Written through the architecture of the home and together with all its elements, it is an invitation into the worlds of windows, tables and sinks that should never be reduced to their mere objecthood.",
                "The book will launch during a special evening event at Flat Time House in Peckham as part of Open House London on Tuesday 20 September 2022 at 6:30pm. The programme will include a live performance of the screenplay for six tables and three humans – ‘The Telling of Tables’ – forming the central piece of Site Report.",
                "It will be possible to purchase a copy of the book at the event.",
