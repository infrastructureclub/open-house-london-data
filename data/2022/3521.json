An oak-panelled Boardroom , deliberately designed to evoke the look and feel of Boardrooms on the Hospital's previous sites, was placed at the heart of its Administration Building. In contrast, the Chapel was built to reflect the contemporary Dutch design. The design of the Hospital as a whole followed the continental 'villa' system, one of only two in England to do so."
