The outdoor area has a community growing section, spaces for wild-life and well-being and the former green is used for wildflower growing, accessible gardening and events. The pavilion is multifunctional, with a large club room used for meetings, socials and making. The training and production kitchen provides space for shared learning and drinks making.",

We collaborate and champion the ideas of those around us, encourage each other to re-imagine new ways of working, trading and existing together, through conversation, care and good company.",
