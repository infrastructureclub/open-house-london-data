                "The project creates an additional floor to a purpose built Victorian maisonette that sits within a conservation area in South West London.",
                "The owner is a film writer. He asked for a space that felt ‘mature’ and was clear that he wanted the connections between the rooms, that were as existing closed off by a narrow main corridor, opened up.",
                "This is done with the staircase area that provides access to the new 2nd floor level. Open treads, an adjacent curved wall, and large 2.5m high doors which when open sit flush with the wall enable the option of connection and views between the living room and kitchen.",
                "The use of full height flush pivot doors is applied throughout and they allow seamless sightlines between one room to another as the occupier moves around the flat. When one ascends the staircase, for example, the silhouette of the exposed chimney on the upper terrace is seen through the study doors.",
                "Oak is used extensively to create a unified palette; for the new windows and doors, the external decking, the kitchen units, on the staircase treads and handrail and as reclaimed boards to the floor. For the kitchen and master bedroom, in which there is an external bath, a new poured floor is used for both practicality and variation.",
                "A Copper roof drapes over the new structure. The copper whose appearance continually evolves with the daily weather and it’s lifespan, is brought into the house through both external views and as detailing on the two terraces."
