                "Crystal Palace Park has a long association with live music going back more than 160 years. From the famous Handel Festivals at the original Palace, to the popular Garden Party Festivals of the 1970s and '80s at Crystal Palace Bowl. Known as the 'Suburban Woodstock' these saw legendary names like Pink Floyd, Elton John, Bob Marley and the Beach Boys liven up the leafy environs of SE19.",
                "In 1997 a new permanent stage was commissioned for the Bowl. Ian Ritchie Architects won a competition with their striking and sculptural design clad in corten steel – its first use on a public building in the UK. A nominee for the 1998 Stirling Prize and winner of multiple architectural awards, the stage has since become a much loved local landmark, affectionately known as the 'Rusty Laptop'.\n \nHowever ater away being dormant for more than a decade, by 2018 it had fallen into a state of disrepair and was at risk of being lost altogether."

South Facing Festival launched the same summer, finally bringing world class acts back to the Palace.",
