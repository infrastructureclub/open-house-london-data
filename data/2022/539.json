Copland was a prominent builder and partner of Henry Holland whose firm made a fortune building barracks for the Government during the Napoleonic Wars. Around the same time, the adjacent Small Mansion was built for Stephen Cosser, who had bought the north-east corner of the park as a separate lot.",
                "In 1835, after Copland’s death, the Large Mansion was bought as a country residence by Nathan Mayer Rothschild, the founder of the English branch of the Rothschild family of bankers. Nathan employed Sydney Smirke to enlarge and embellish the house.",

He had trained and worked with his brother, Sir Robert Smirke, and between them they also designed a number of London clubs. Many of his drawings for the refurbishment of the Large Mansion still exist at the Royal Institute of British Architects and at New Court, home of the Rothschild Archive."

                "The building is stuccoed brick with a lead and slate roof hidden by parapets. The north front has three storeys with sash windows, which are arched on the first floor. It is broken into three vertical sections by cornerstones and divided horizontally by string-courses. A central porte cochere is supported by four Doric columns and four pilasters and has an open-work scale pattern design on its parapet, which is echoed in the cast-iron balconies of the first-floor rooms on the wings. The south front has a three-storey centre section between two-storey wings. It is slightly recessed to create a Doric-columned loggia. The eastern end is a conservatory, for which Smirke produced several designs. The western end, built in plainer style, houses the large kitchens and domestic offices."
