                "Wrapped around the Gtech Community Stadium, home to Brentford F.C and rugby union’s London Irish, Apo Kew Bridge sits at the heart of the Brentford East regeneration project, a vibrant West London neighborhood which houses a growing community of high-street retailers, cafés and restaurants, just moments from Kew Bridge station. On matchdays, residents have a bird’s-eye view of the dramatic Premier League football action on display at the 17,250-seater sports venue just next door and can soak up the incredible atmosphere!",
                "Apo Kew Bridge provides 487 rental homes across four buildings, consisting of studio flats, and one, two, and three-bedroom apartments, available both unfurnished and furnished by Danish-inspired contemporary furniture design company BoConcept. Aside from apartments, Apo membership also includes 24/7 assistance from a friendly team of resident hosts, as well as free Wi-Fi, parcel lockers, and on-site maintenance services",

                "Apo also engages with its members in these spaces via a rolling calendar of activities, including yoga classes, street food markets, pub quizzes, workshops, and live music nights. These ongoing social events on the doorstep of Apo residents encourage neighbours to become friends and fosters an authentic sense of community spirit. With most events hosted in collaboration with local brands and enterprises, and some events open to members of the wider community, Apo Kew Bridge is firmly established within the local area as a distinct, vibrant new neighbourhood.",
                "Connecting residents beyond their local neighbourhood, Apo Kew Bridge has fantastic transport links, with Kew Bridge station only a 3-minute walk and offering rail travel to Waterloo in under 30 minutes.
