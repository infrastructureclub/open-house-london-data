Homes were to be arranged in terraces, sometimes stepped, to take advantage of the views across London. This was to become Central Hill Estate.",
                "At the time the estate was Lambethâ€™s newest and biggest housing estate. It provided residents with gardens, large terraces, play areas and grassed squares and a much-needed hostel for nurses from Croydon hospital. The estate is under threat of demolition by Lambeth Council who wish to increase the density by building a high-rise development by any means necessary."

These walkways connect homes with playgrounds and green spaces with all cars kept to the periphery. This was Ted Hollamby's favourite estate in Lambeth as it was designed around the needs of the people and community. It is a low-rise high-density scheme on a complex site on one of the highest points in London. The design makes best use of the Parker Morris space standards with each housing unit having a private front garden, dual aspect and a large rear patio area over looking the city."

Dual aspect flats at slightly different floor levels have balconies on both sides. With one block of housing over the shop, the other at Lunham Road, Peartree House is situated over a secret nuclear bunker one of the first projects built on the site in 1963."

Lambeth created its own Special Purpose Vehicle to bypass its own planning process to kick start demolition even before a resident ballot or proper environmental assessments have been made. Central Hill is one of six estates being demolished to make way for housing that does not replace the social housing that it wished to replace."
