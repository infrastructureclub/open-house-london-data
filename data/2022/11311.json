Bedford Park has been described as the world's first garden suburb, creating a model of apparent informality emulated around the world. The development is protected by a conservation area in the London Borough of Ealing, and a smaller one in the London Borough of Hounslow. Over 350 of its buildings are Grade II-listed; the church and the inn are Grade II*-listed.",
