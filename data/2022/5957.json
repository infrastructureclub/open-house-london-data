The scale increases at the two prominent mews street corners, where each block is crowned with a rooftop pavilion set back from the main façade. The highest nine-storey block provides a distinctive feature to hold the corner of the site and help mediate between the scale of the new block and the existing tower.",
                "The qualities of Peabody’s existing nineteenth century housing estates, along with the terrace house typology, are the reference points for the choice of materials and details. Two tones of brick are used. A rich buff brick predominates, and lighter creamy/white “gault” brick is used where the blocks are set back at higher levels. All residential units are dual aspect with optimal levels of daylight. Large external balconies are either recessed on the street frontages or project over the communal garden within. Private terraces for the ground floor family units provide a buffer between the private residences and the shared garden."
