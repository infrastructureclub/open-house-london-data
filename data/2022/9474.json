                "Located at the heart of Somers Town, the Community Facilities seek to act as a gleaming beacon in the park – with the rooftop Multi Use Games Area (MUGA) and shop windows lighting the park at night.  The design has been tailored to the very specific needs of each user group, whilst retaining flexibility and adaptability for future use by different users or even a single institution. The facilities have been carefully designed to allow wider community use and to project a welcoming, public presence directly facing the new park, whilst still maintaining privacy and safeguarding for the host users. The MUGA is accessible to the public and can be hired out to provide internal revenue.",
                "The play club and drama workshop are laid out along a public park as an enfilade of courts and rooms, held together by a unifying celebratory façade, A strong hierarchy of openings, glimpses into courtyards and deep window reveals quietly satisfy the many and stringent privacy demands, whilst projecting welcome and vitality. The shopfront windows will display the children’s work to the neighbourhood, whilst screening the more private interiors beyond.",
                "Swooping inverted arches enclose a rooftop sports pitch in a distortion of scale - a grandeur at odds with real-size like a child’s model of a palace.  The small tower of housing affirms the scale of the street whilst maintaining this delicate quality. The interiors further develop this play of scale. The rooms are tall, of exposed concrete and lined with large windows. These robust shells are fitted with Douglas Fir glazed partitions in an evident layering like a factory - creating functional rooms and structuring the open volume to create defined nooks within an overall discipline of clear sight lines. The matrix of courtyards and rooms gives a rich porosity, flexibility of use and natural ventilation.",
                "The adventure playground includes high-level access for wheelchair users and is designed as an armature for adaptation and improvisation by children and staff.   \nThe flats are naturally ventilated and cooled, including the use of thermal mass and external blinds.",
                "This project is part of a wider £85 million regeneration of Central Somers Town by Camden Council. Our close collaboration with the other practices involved was a key feature of the project. The Community Facilities are the key part of the overall regeneration project and build on a strong sense of the neighbourhood’s identity and character."
