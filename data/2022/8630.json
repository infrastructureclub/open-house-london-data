The building acknowledges its Islamic heritage while fitting harmoniously in its home within the urban environment of the conservation area of Bethnal Green. It incorporates elements of traditional Islamic geometry and calligraphy and the interplay of light and shadow to create a space designed to support spiritual practices and experience.",
                "Inspired by the words of Hazrat Azad Rasool (ra), grand-shaykh of the order, that “Silence is the knock upon the inner door”, the space encourages a contemplative state supporting the seeker in turning away from the world, fostering a gradual movement towards the inner self and what is beyond the self."

                "The School of Sufi Teaching (UK) is dedicated to the spiritual practices of the Naqshbandī- Mujaddidī Sufi order, whose masters can be traced directly back to the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). The School was founded by Hazrat Azad Rasool (ra), grand shaykh of the Naqshbandī-Mujaddidī sufi order and director of the Institute of Search for Truth. Hazrat’s son and deputy, Shaykh Hazrat Hamid Hasan, now leads the order and provides initiation and guidance to people on the path of sufism. The School offers instruction in the teachings of five Sufi orders – the Naqshbandī, Mujaddidī, Chishtī, Qadirī, and Shadhilī – with special emphasis on the Mujaddidī practices. The aim of the School is to serve the needs of people from all backgrounds who are seeking spiritual advancement and may benefit from authentic sufi teachings.",
                "In spring 2020 the School is opening its doors to a wider community in its beautiful new home in East London. Our new building or zāwiyah is a gathering place for travellers on the sufi path. It provides a space where seekers can devote themselves to spiritual practices and find guidance in the company of the shaykh and fellow students."

The community area includes a well-equipped kitchen and bathroom facilities, as well as a space for seminars, workshops, exhibitions, and events. This public area is envisioned as a space for engagement for practitioners in different fields, ranging from art, architecture, and design to literature, poetry, and complementary therapies, seeking connections between creative and spiritual endeavours and holistic approaches to professional practices. The Centre creates a link between physical and spiritual realms and an opportunity to explore the relationship between sacred space and spiritual experience."
