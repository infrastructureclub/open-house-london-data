                "This house is owned by exhibition designer and ceramicist Philip Hughes and ceramicist Vanessa Hogge. The living rooms and hallway were adapted to provide a gallery for art and ceramics. In the beginning of Lockdown in March 2020, a group of artists and ceramicists gathered to create an online exhibition in the newly formed 'Living Object' gallery.",
                "Using Zoom, Instagram, Instagram Live and Facebook, the event was publicised and connected with virtual visitors from around the world.The artists conducted online studio tours and explained their processes live to virtual visitors.",
                "Further exhibitions followed culminating in the 'Virtual Neighbour' exhibition in which four artists designed virtual exhibits in an imagined space neighbouring the Living Object gallery. A garden space was added in 2021 with an innovative canopy with a mechanically openable roof."
