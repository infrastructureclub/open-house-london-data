                "At Barking and Dagenham we are building 3,000 new Council-owned homes over the next five years. These will mostly be homes to rent, and will be at prices that local people and other ordinary working Londoners can afford.",
                "But although these wonâ€™t be expensive houses, we want to build them to the highest design standards so they are not only affordable to live in but are easy to maintain and pleasing to look at. We want to build homes that will last and create places that people will be proud to live in and call home. Places where people want to spend time, put down roots, bring up children and even grow old.",
                "The walking tour will visit the following projects which uphold our ambitions of delivering beautiful, affordable homes:\nCrown House, designed by Carey Jones Chapman Tolcher and completed in 2022, is located on the Market Traders Car Park site in Barking Town Centre and delivers 172 residential apartments.",
                "A House for Artists by APPARATA is an ambitious, replicable model for affordable, sustainable housing tied to long-term civic engagement in Barking Town Centre in East London. The first of its kind in the UK, A House for Artists, provides flexible living space for twelve artists and their families, with studio workspaces, a ground-floor community space and a shared working yard that can be opened to the public.",
                "North Street designed by Peter Barber provides a picturesque terrace of 14 dwellings on a small strip of land, previously thought undevelopable, between Webber House and North Street.",
                "Gascoigne West 1 designed by White Arkitekter and completed in 2022, ensures a future proofed design that will support the ongoing regeneration in Barking. The development features 201 well planned, efficient, high-quality apartments, with private and communal amenity space. The new accommodation is split into three blocks, varying in form and character, and ranging from three to 13 storeys, including seven terraced houses.",
                "Gascoigne West 2 was designed by White Arkitekter and is currently under construction providing 386 new homes for council-owned regeneration company, Be First. With attractive and accessible open spaces that are open to all, the scheme is set to improve the health and wellbeing of Gascoigne Estate residents of all generations.",
                "Phoenix Park is a resident led co-designed and built pocket park developed as a meanwhile space as part of a larger estate wide regeneration within the Gascoigne neighborhood by Gascoigne Resident Forum & Fabrik. It was completed in summer 2021.",
                "Gascoigne East Phase 2 designed White Arkitekter and currently under construction is split into five blocks consisting of 11 new buildings ranging from 4 to 14 storeys which frame a 5,000 sqm park at the heart of the scheme. High quality urban amenity spaces are linked by a green corridor running from North to South of the site enhancing the identity of the Estate. The two main blocks both frame large podium-level shared gardens promoting permeability across the site and social interaction between residents."
