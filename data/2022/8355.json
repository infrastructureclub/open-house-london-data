This became the Ladywell Self-Build Community Hub project.",
                "RUSS led a successful crowd funding initiative in 2017 raising funds for the project from 320 backers. This included funds from The Mayor of London’s initiative, Crowdfund London. Other key donors include CDS Cooperatives, Ladywell Assembly (Lewisham Council), Jon Broome Architects, Weston Williamson + Partners, Footwork, Bringelly and Viridor.",
                "The project involved getting volunteers together to build London’s first training facility for would-be community self-builders. RUSS worked with Contractor Habitat for Humanity GB (Homes) to deliver the project which gave people the opportunity to get hands-on experience of building.",
                "Opening in autumn 2019, the space hosts RUSS’s School of Community-Led Housing with the goal of becoming a knowledge hub to share and inspire other communities in self-building and affordable housing projects. The space also provides a community space to bring new RUSS housing residents and the existing community together. It can be hired by local organisations for meetings and events, and used as a co-working space.",
