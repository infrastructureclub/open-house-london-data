We tell our client’s stories through bespoke artworks, playing in the space between brand expression and fine art. We exist as a dynamic, art-driven eco-system assuming the role of creator, curator, and activator at different points through the projects we deliver.",

A space where art gets conceived, made, exhibited, and celebrated. We invite you to come and explore our world, get to know our people, network with the creative community, and in true Acrylicize tradition, add your own unique flavour and perspective to the experience. We love how creativity connects us to each other and the spaces we inhabit. The Art House stands in service to this principle.",
