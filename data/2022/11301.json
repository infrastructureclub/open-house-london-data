                "Please be aware that access to the wharf is down a set of steps, and the boats are accessed by stepping across from the pontoon to the deck. Once inside, ceilings are low and space is small, particularly in the narrowboats. All three boats have steps down into the cabin.",
                "The entrance to Haggerston Wharf is through a natural larch timber door nestled in tree foliage off a quiet pedestrian path. A galvanised steel and timber staircase, elevated above the wharf’s wild zone, takes you down to the pontoon. The pontoon is offset from the historic red brick canal wall, which has enabled us to reintroduce native reeds and other water borne plants and insert corrugated steel planters for herbaceous plants and climbers.",

                "A 50ft long traditional stern style canal boat with a 6ft 10” beam. The steel hull was built in 1991 by Colecraft Engineering Ltd.\nDodgily named and dodgily decorated, inside she’s a much-loved floating patchwork of donated furniture, things found in skips, unfinished DIY and bodge jobs. Freezing in winter, boiling in summer, she’s a perfect vantage point to spy on all the dramas of the canal and towpath. I once gave myself a concussion walking in to the cabin, so mind your head."

Wooden steps (which also function as storage drawers) descend into the galley/kitchen  of an open plan living area with a wood stove and sofa. The main cabin is divided from the sleeping area at the front of the boat by a bathroom cabin with a curved wall. The boat has five large bus-style windows plus two large (15”) portholes. In addition to the rear hatch entrance there is a side hatch and doors opening to the front deck."

                "Built in 2002 by Liverpool Boats, Hetty Clare was first bought as a sail away and the interior was fitted out by Paul Simpsons Boats - who specialise in traditional canal boat interiors with a modern finish. The bathroom and engine room were renovated in 2019 and 2020, creating more space and a home office. The boat interior is spacious and well lit, with plenty of storage throughout.",
                "Entering from the bow into the main living area, there is a generous ceiling height and an open plan saloon with multi-fuel stove and a galley kitchen leading to the master bedroom. The master bedroom has a full height wardrobe, chest of drawers, and double bed. The spacious bathroom has a compost loo, ¾ bath with an overhead shower, and wash basin. The engine room at the stern was renovated in 2020 to serve as a cosy back office, with additional storage and good access to the engine and batteries.",
                "A wooden, fully removable, roof deck was fitted earlier this year, providing a slice of outdoor space to enjoy the sunsets on the wharf and socialise."
