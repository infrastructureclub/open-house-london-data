                "The building was constructed alongside the other properties on Princelet Street between “1705–6 by Joseph Truman, the brewer, on a piece of Joyce’s Garden bought from Samuel Hannott and his wife Elizabeth in 1705”. Like its neigh- bours in 21-23 it was originally “built of yellow brick, red brick being used for the bandcourses between the storeys, and for the jambs and gauged flat arches of the windows. These are evenly spaced, the single-fronted houses having three in each upper storey, and the double having five. In addition there are narrow blind windows on the extreme right of the second and third storeys of No. 25.”",
                "It seems likely that the elevation was substantially repaired in the 19th century, and a rendered skirting added, which can be seen in the photograph from 1955. It is unclear the extent of alterations to the elevation carried out before Second World War but there appears that the building was refaced at some stage, as evident in the appearance of Victorian red multistock bricks mixed in with the yellow brickwork, and poorly tied in facing brick to the masonry behind. The upper storey appears to modern (though apparent in 1955) and built in a multi- stock brick.",
                "“The front was originally finished with a moulded wooden cornice. (fn. 109) Wooden doorcases, still existing at Nos. 21 and 25, were probably standardized for all these houses. The tall rectangular door opening has a moulded architrave frame, flanked by narrow panelled pilasters with carved consoles supporting the cornice-hood”. “All the windows, except those in the rebuilt top storey of No. 25, have exposed flush frames, generally with modern sashes.”",
                "The building was listed with adjacent neighbour in 1950, but with little descrip- tion of the existing state of the building or mention of the interior.",
                "The building has suffered various ad hoc repairs made in the last 50 years, where modern materials were introduced alongside the historic fabric, as the building passed through multiple ownerships and was for a time squatted by local groups."
