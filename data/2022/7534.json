                "Thamesmead Stage One was built in the late sixties and was intended to provide housing of the future for those who currently lived in cramped and run down conditions within Inner London. First designed and built by the GLC, these properties were to be futuristic and forward thinking homes for those who needed it most.",
                "Built on marshlands on what was old Royal Arsenal Land, Thamesmead  was a self-contained city in the sky, with its elevated walkways, man-made lakes and expansive green areas, it felt like such a contrast from the cramped and damp conditions of inner London.",
                "Despite some undoubted successes, a lack of investment and infrastructure has meant that Thamesmead is yet to fully to live up to initial potential. However, just over 50 years after its creation, with investment of over £1 billion now coming in, Thamesmead is now well set to fulfil its promise as London's new town.",
                "The Southmere development, where The Nest takes it's central position on the main square, is at the heart of what was stage one and forms part of Peabody's investment in Thamesmead."

                "When Peabody incorporated Thamesmead's three leading organisations in 2014, it meant that much of the town's housing, community investment activities and over 200 acres of developable land became owned by a single, well-resourced body for the first time in a generation.",
                "As Thamesmead’s main landowner, Peabody is driving the town's regeneration in collaboration with partners. Thamesmead is one of Peabody's core priorities, and a dedicated Thamesmead regeneration team has been built up to deliver the ambitious vision for change in the town.",
                "Peabody is one of London's oldest and largest housing associations and has been creating opportunities for Londoners since 1862 when it was established by the American banker and philanthropist, George Peabody. Its mission is to ensure that as many people as possible have a good home, a real sense of purpose and a strong feeling of belonging.",
                "Housing associations, Peabody and Family Mosaic merged to create a new Peabody in July 2017. Working across 21 locations in London and the South East, we own and manage more than 55,000 homes, providing affordable housing for around 111,000 people."

                "The design of the new Civic & Library building at Southmere\nis the result of an RIBA competition which was won by Bisset Adams.\nThe building is set over two floors with an additional\nmezzanine level. The new library will be located on the ground floor offering a variety of study areas in addition to a cafe, meeting rooms, children's library and IT suite. The first floor provides a multi-purpose space which could provide\nfacilities such as toddler groups, local clubs and yoga.\nThis is supported by further community spaces on the mezzanine level which  include a health room.\nThe library space is predominantly glazed to create views both into and out of the building and to make the interior spaces feel connected to the surrounding landscape.\nThe flexible, multi-use space above the main library space is\norientated differently from the base of the building, rotated\nto face over Southmere Lake for the fantastic views and to\nreflect the irregular form of a Swan’s nest.\nA wild flower green roof and sky light provides visual\namenity for the neighbouring residents and helps to increase\nbiodiversity."
