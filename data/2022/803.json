                "The Abbey Mills Pumping Station (Pumping Station A)  is central to the sewerage system created across London in the mid-19th century. Built to lift sewage from the low-lying sewers, it collects a huge amount of the capitalâ€™s wastewater, transferring it to our northern outfall sewer and on to Beckton STW.",

                "Abbey Mills is an early example of the work of Charles Driver, who assisted Bazalgette and Cooper. Driver specialised in engineering-based work, particularly railways. His designs include stations on the south London line, and those at Box Hill and Tunbridge Wells West. He established a considerable practice and obtained overseas commissions, such as the Central Market in Santiago, Chile."
