Travelling at over 3000 miles per hour, over four times faster than the speed of sound, no warning of its approach could be given and no defence was possible.  Hear the story of what happened when a public house, the Crooked Billet, packed with people was struck by a V2 rocket and how, in 2011, those who were killed and injured were to be commemorated by a blue plaque on the rebuilt pub."
