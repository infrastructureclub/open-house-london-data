                "49 Belgrave Square is a four-storey mansion built around 1851 for Sidney Herbert, later Lord Herbert of Lea, by Thomas Cubitt in “his later manner, quoined and astylar [without columns or similar vertical features] with a canted bow”. The porch and octagonal hall were added in 1859 by Mayhew and Knight and the interiors modified by Mewes and Davis before 1914.",
                "Because of its position between Halkin Street and Grosvenor Crescent, the building was known for many years as ‘The Independent North Mansion’ though named as ‘Belgrave Villa’ by Sidney Herbert and as ‘The Villa’ by his successor in 1861, the 6th Duke of Richmond. After the 7th Duke died in 1928 the house was acquired by the gold and diamond magnate Sir Otto Beit and sold by his son Sir Alfred in 1936, when it became the residence of the Argentine Ambassador.",
                "The historic mansion was acquired in 1936 by Argentina with its furniture and paintings. Beautiful and precious objects, lamps, works of art, tapestries, mirrors, all give character, grandiosity, and an allure of a time gone by."

These rooms lead successively into the spacious DINING ROOM with its cream panelled walls and dark pink marble fireplace.",

It curves round to the first-floor landing, at the further end of which a similar spiral staircase continues to the upper floors below an oblong skylight.",

In addition -  the reception organised in 1990 for the restitution of diplomatic relations between Buenos Aires and London; the official visits of three Argentine presidents; and two contemporary art exhibitions ‘Casa Abierta – Open House’ which took place during Open House London 2006 and 2010.",
                "For the 15th year running, we invite visitors to delve into Argentina’s cultural roots — from design, music to the arts — and to experience a journey through Belgrave Villa´s history and architecture, with its sumptuous interiors still intact, including a collection of paintings, furniture and tapestries.",
                "Fifteen years ago, in 2006, the Argentine Ambassador’s Residence was the first Embassy to open its doors to the public for London Open House."
