                "On returning to Britain he continued the amateur group \nnaming it after the local telephone dialling area code: Mountview.",
                "Peter Coxhead, the founder, trained at RADA and began coaching drama school hopefuls for their auditions, eventually formalising this training into an acting foundation course.",
                "Full-time three-year acting and production arts diploma courses followed; the purpose was always to train young people for careers in theatre, film, TV and radio.",
                "In 1992 Mountview launched the first three-year vocational musical theatre course in Europe and in 1999 through a validating partnership with University of East Anglia Mountview awarded its first BA (Hons) degrees. In subsequent years postgraduate courses in performance, direction and producing were launched.",
                "After 73 years in north London, much of it in rented accommodation, Mountview had a need to move into its own home. Southwark Council identified a brownfield site next to the Sterling Prize winning Peckham Library and also provided a financial package to allow Mountview to begin construction whilst fundraising for the remainder of the build cost.",
                "Mountview opened in September 2018 and following the completion of a capital fundraising campaign, including a £1m donation from the Mackintosh Foundation, its main theatre, named The Mack, officially opened in 2021 with a production of Les Miserables."

Training facilities include 21 studios, music practice rooms, production workshops, meeting rooms, two TV studios and a radio suite. Further spaces include work space, a retail unit and a 195-m2 rehearsal studio for commercial hire.",
                "The building was built on a vacant brown-field which which had once been home to Area 10, a ‘found’ creative space/performing arts space. Before that the site had housed Whitten’s timber yard and, originally, a canal-side warehouse. It was built by the award-winning contractor Gilbert-Ash who recently completed the Stirling Prize winning Liverpool Everyman Theatre.",
