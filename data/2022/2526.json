                "Here in East Ham we have a complete Norman church which is Grade 1 listed.\nIn 1130 the church consisted of a semicircular Apse, Sanctuary. Chancel and Nave which are essentially unaltered apart from four windows in decorated style inserted in Victorian times and a large three light window of around 1600 -1630. \nA tower was added circa 1230 thus protecting the west end of the church and leaving us with the beautifully preserved Norman arch of the original west entrance.\nThe church contains many interesting features including an Anchoriteâ€™s Cell, Cistercian wall paintings (now largely covered to preserve them but still visible in some places),  the original timbers of the Apse roof, some brasses and a number of fine monuments two of which date from Jacobean times. \nThe tower houses one bell weighing about half a ton, cast in 1380 making it one of the oldest bells in London in regular use.\nThe surrounding graveyard of about 9.5 acres is managed as a nature reserve.  The area immediately in front of the church is kept tidy for visitors and includes a memorial garden dedicated in 2011.\nThe graveyard contains a memorial to two cousins lost in the Titanic disaster, a memorial to a boy born on HMS Temaraire (which took part in the battle of Trafalgar) and a memorial to a man who died in a ballooning accident at Crystal Palace in 1892.\nA guide book to St Mary Magdalene is available from the church together with a selection of photographs, postcards and other souvenirs."
