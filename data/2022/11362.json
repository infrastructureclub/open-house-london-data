                "I have a love affair with extending the footprint of homes, modernising them and updating their overall design - this house is no exception.  Plus, finding significant garden space in London is rare, so I knew we had a gem packed full of opportunity and a chance to create a very special home.",
                "The property hadn’t seen a paint brush since the 90s, and it soon became clear that it was still being serviced with old electrics and a very old air heating system.  We stripped out the electrics and installed a new central heating system, as well as two new Regulation A fuse boards – one for the existing structure and a separate one for the new build extensions. This made it easier to separate the electrics and identify any faults.",
                "After doing this initial renovation which also included top to bottom plastering, decorating and re designing the bathroom, we focused on creating the extensions and increasing the size of the house.  Getting to the extension build stage required a fair amount of design time, and communication with our local authority but our planning approval was granted months later so it was time to get to work.",
                "We had to move some of the existing drains, which were dug up to 2m below ground and relocated with the support of a Thames Water approved contractor.",
                "We installed new double glazed windows to the extension as well as to the existing home.",
                "The new kitchen was established as the focus and the hub of the home in the new extension, with underfloor heating extending into the new utility room, guest bedroom and ensuite eliminating the need for any wall radiators downstairs in the extension.  The upstairs area of the extension includes a primary bedroom and large ensuite with a full height vaulted ceiling throughout creating an extra layer of bright natural light and lots of space.",
                "With the extension built and a garden office being erected, I focused on another aspect of design that I love - the interior design and styling."

                "With a background in fashion design and being a child of the 70s, I bring my love, knowledge and experience of combining colours, patterns, materials and fabrics to my home.",
                "I love working from an initial white box or canvas and gradually, overtime I fill this box with layers of colour through wall paints, tiles, funky flooring materials etc.  I then add patterns through fabrics, furniture and soft furnishings.  The look is then gradually completed with the right accessories such as art, lamps, plants and one off second hand finds.",
                "My Partner who has Certified as a low energy (passivhaus) builder, has worked in the building industry for more than 30 years, managing and working on projects for individual homeowners through to multimillion pound commercial sites.",
                "Together we combine our passion for transforming unloved homes and constantly push the boundaries of style whilst increasing the property value and practicality in our projects."
