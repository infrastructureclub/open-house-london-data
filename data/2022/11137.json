                "Designed by Michael Davis, the 4,600sq-ft home-turned-art gallery was created for his partner, the British artist and sculptor Andrew Logan. Bought by the couple in December 1988, the plot originally consisted of a concrete garage topped by a flat. Gaining inspiration from a trip to Mexico, Davis added an extra floor to the space and painted it pink. Additionally, Davis incorporated stairs on the outside, inserted windows at the front, and installed the glass roof to create a large conservatory-like studio. The result was a unique and creative three-bedroom / art studio studio space, containing Logan’s mosaic sculptures, artifacts, and jewelry. After living in it for twenty-five years, Logan sold the property. Since 2015, it has served as a gallery space for Kristin Hjellegjerde Gallery. Although shifting from an artist’s studio to a commercial gallery, the space maintains the same exhibition function as it did for Logan. As Sally Kindberg writes, there remains a crucial ‘dialogue between the artworks and the architectural space,’ which varies according to each exhibition."

                "From street level, the building is distinguished from its surroundings by its curved facade, which extends from Melior Place to the adjacent Melior Street. The vast expanse of concrete, enriched with blue render, further emphasises the exterior’s striking impression. In Catherine Rapley’s words, the building appears as ‘a fortress, a defence against the urban sprawl of Bermondsey, south London.’ Although the colourful exterior departs from the more austere one inhabited by Logan, there are some references to the earlier design. Notably, the wide industrial doors and visible winch point to the building’s original mixed-use function as an artist’s studio and private home. The colourful yet unassuming exterior masks the building’s wonderfully eclectic interior, where ‘everything is outsized, shiny, and colour-soaked’ (Rapley). On the lower floor, the building’s original textured blue kitchen and glass mosaic bathroom remain from Davis’s refurbishment. In contrast to this more dimly lit space, the second floor is flooded with natural light, which enters the plant-fringed gallery from an expansive glass gable roof. This conservatory-style canopy room gives the building its nickname: the Glasshouse. Because of its large-scale and open-plan scheme, the room provides the flexibility ideal for an exhibition venue. In Logan’s words, the space is ‘basically four walls with a hole in the top that you can do anything with.’ Tall ferns and plants give the double-height room the appearance of a greenhouse; Harry de Quetteville describes it as ‘like something from Kew Gardens.’ Foliage extends from interior to the second-storey terrace, from which ivy descends to cover the gallery’s facade. The unique building is testament to London’s innovative art scene as it uses architecture to blur the line between inside and out, redefining the concept of ‘city living.’"
