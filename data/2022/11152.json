                "Since 2020, the Migration Museum has been based in a former H&M in the heart of Lewisham Shopping Centre, where we stage engaging exhibitions and dynamic events, alongside a far-reaching education programme for primary, secondary, university and adult learners. In April 2022, we opened our latest exhibition Taking Care of Business: Migrant Entrepreneurs and the Making of Britain, and our Migrant Makers Market, a concept store and makerspace championing products made by migrant-owned businesses and where we host regular maker-led workshops.",
