                "The project is located on Allerton Road, a street directly below the West Reservoir in Stoke Newington, London Borough of Hackney. The area was developed in the late part of the 19th century, with William Hardy leasing the estate in 1882 and agreeing to complete the west part of Allerton Road by building at least 10 houses per year. Number 22 is expected to have been built between 1882 and 1888, when 66 houses were completed in the area.  Stoke Newington has been going through constant regeneration during the past years, with new creative businesses, shops and restaurants transforming the community and therefore attracting more young families. It is therefore understandable that most of these houses require modernisation to cater for the current ways of living, hence the requested alterations on this specific project.\nAllerton Road and its immediate borders are not in a designated conservation area."

                "The proposal aims to improve the ground floor layout and usability of the space, while dealing with the problematic access to the rear garden and the lack of natural light.\nThe major problems that are being tackled with the proposed design are (1) the lack of a large, bright living space for the family, with plenty of storage (2) having a poorly constructed rear façade that allows restricted natural light and draft while blocking the views and access to the garden (3) having an overlooked side façade and an external space with no provision for a private family area.\nThe proposal follows the Borough’s policy requirements for well-designed, high quality schemes and has been respectful of the expectations stated in City of London Local Plan concerning the high quality of architecture and design of new developments in the area. The proposed space has been carefully designed to fit the needs of the owners, with high quality materials that ensure a sustainable living, ample natural light and better facilities provision. The building fabric will be highly insulated to reduce its energy losses and the proposed architecture suggests clean lines with volumetric separation through materials, hygienic spaces with strong natural light sources and good ventilation."

                "The proposed design deals with the aforementioned issues through tailor-made solutions for each affected area, all of them listed in detail below:",
                "(1)\tProposed Extension",
                "The ground floor part of the house is redesigned, with the addition of a modern rear extension that aims to provide enough space for a new large kitchen and dining area together with plenty of storage units and seating. Large openings on the rear façade ensure beautiful views of the garden together with ample amounts of natural light coming into the space.",
                "Bifold doors can be tucked away against the wall and give the option of connecting the inside of the house to the external space on a sunny day. There is a small covered area where the garden can be enjoyed when the weather is not ideal and can provide the much needed cross ventilation for the kitchen.",
                "A sunken seating area is designed to sit two steps below the floor level to ensure the garden views are not blocked, where the family can entertain guests. Finally a large new skylight and a patio have been placed in key locations of the house, bringing natural light deep into the long floor-plan, explained in more detail below.",
                "The new open plan kitchen/dining space is separated from the original part of the building by a 3.7m long patio that is designed to bring in natural light towards the darker areas of the house. By using glazing in all three sides of the patio we have also created a visual connection, meaning views of the garden can be enjoyed even from the living area at the front of the house.",
                "Having green patches visible from most of the ground floor areas gives the space calmness and improves the quality of living by providing fresh air circulation, light and association with nature, all invaluable commodities in an urban environment.",
                "(2)\tProposed Rear Facade",
                "The old facade is being rethought, with the poor quality PVC windows removed and replaced with modern, high performing aluminium glazing. Window openings are enlarged horizontally to bring in more southern light and more views of the garden. The painted red bricks are covered in a dark grey concrete textured cladding, with thermal insulation installed in between for energy efficiency. The waste pipes are re-routed and concealed inside the façade cavity to improve the aesthetics of the building.",
                "(3)\tNew patio and porch",
                "As mentioned above, the new kitchen extension is separated from the original part of the building by a 3.7m long patio, which serves many purposes. Apart from bringing in natural light and providing ventilation, the small external space acts as a buffer zone for privacy from the neighbour. Having plants growing in it together with its glazing being set back by 1.8m from the party wall, the patio ensures that the family is not overlooked by the many openings on the neighbour’s side façade.\nThe external porch acts as another privacy screen, visually blocking the sunken seating area from the adjacent property."

                "Natural light is achieved on the ground floor with two large new openings on the rear façade receiving direct south facing warm light. The bifold panes are tall and thin framed, maximising the intake. \nA large new skylight is positioned above the kitchen space with timber beams placed on an angle to allow direct light during the winter but blocking most of the vertical summer sun to avoid overheating. \nFinally, as explained before, a patio is strategically placed in the middle of the long floor-plan to improve the natural light intake of the deeper and therefore darker parts of the house.",
                "Thermal insulation is an absolutely vital element of every modern build. Rigid insulating panels will be added to all new walls floor and roof, so as to improve energy loss and achieve modern sustainability levels. The proposed windows and doors are double glazed and high performing to avoid cold bridges.",
                "Cross Ventilation is an often overlooked but absolutely crucial element of a quality design. The proposed scheme ensures there is air circulating the long ground floor, with the patio placed in the middle of the layout and acting as a fresh air well for the entire space.",
                "Sound insulation can be a big issue for most of these older Victorian properties. To tackle this, specific walls, ceilings and floors will be layered with high performing loosely packed fibre boards, which provide excellent sound absorption."

                "On the front façade of the building, the original brickwork is cleaned, re-pointed and lime-washed and the PVC windows  replaced with traditional timber sash windows to bring back the character of the property. \nThe rear façade is finished in dark grey concrete textured cladding and all new openings are oak framed shutter-proof double glazing. \nThe new rear extension is built in light grey bricks with poured concrete plinths complementing the colour of the bricks. All bifold doors and windows of the ground floor are oak timber framed. The sunken seating area of the rear garden is finished in light weather treated poured concrete with microcement details. \nInternally, references to the same materials can be found throughout the space, in the hand-crafted oak joinery, concrete plinth details and poured terrazzo floors.",
