                "JeeYoung hopes that these origami objects, the boat, planes and swans floating in a Gingko leaf sea, will trigger thoughts, memories and give an opportunity for people to harness their own memories and rediscover their own stories. This is not an installation which requires you to understand the artist’s intention, it is a moment to revisit your own experience, find a resonance within the work and relive a moment that was special.",
                "Spend time in the exhibition to contemplate your first memory. Write it down on a piece of origami paper and fold into a swan to add to the collection which will grow during the exhibition. Her everyday objects she hopes will act as a key to hidden memories.",
