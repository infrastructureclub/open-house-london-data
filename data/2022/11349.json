                "At the heart of the planning and development of the Olympic Park was the commitment to fulfil a number of objectives that would underpin the regeneration of the East end of London. As new development was realised, it was critical that a strong relationship between these new neighbourhoods and the Canal Park was forged. Canal Park sits over two historic 42” water mains that created both design constraint and opportunity. The concept recognised the heritage of the Lea Navigation while embellishing the towpath within a landscape framework of ecological patchiness."
