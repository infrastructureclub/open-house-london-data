In this event, we will take you on a walk around Kings Cross starting at Granary Square, using everyday objects and spaces to elaborate on a set of ideas about extractive capitalism and its consequences: climate and ecological breakdown. \nExtraction is both material and immaterial: knowledge, labour, and capital are extracted as much as materials and energy. Spinning out stories that touch on all these aspects of extraction, we will not only be critical about the ways in which the built environment reflects extractivist processes, but also consider possibilities for other ways to act as we face the climate emergency."
