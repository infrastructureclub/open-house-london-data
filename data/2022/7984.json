The building offers 237,700 sq ft of column-free creative office space split across fifteen storeys. The asymmetrical steel exoskeleton, dramatic double-height ground floor reception and two large roof terraces revealing spectacular views across London, make this development truly unique."

In contrast to more orthodox office blocks, it has set new standards for the area and for London as a whole."

In addition to responding to the challenges of the site, this innovative structure also enabled the provision of column-free floors and a flexible layout. Further, the structural elevation provides shading to 20% of the façade – reducing energy use and waste, and improving access to light and views around the Paddington Basin. Brunel Building uses geothermal heating and cooling with two 180m-deep boreholes accessing the substrata aquifer. Brunel Building has achieved BREEAM Excellent and LEED Gold and and EPC-B rating."

The design allowed the main entrance to re-engage with the canal, and for the first time since Paddington Basin was opened more than 200 years ago, the public has access to a new, tree-lined canal towpath that links the Basin with Little Venice. Artworks by James Capper and Gavin Turk complement the public realm and the industrial ethos of the building."
