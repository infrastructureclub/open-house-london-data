                "By the sixteenth century, multitudes of English Christians were demanding reform in their church. They sensed that the church had become corrupt and selfish, and that it had largely left the simple message of the Bible. Separatists decided to separate from the Church of England and form their own independent congregations. Some of these Separatists, studying the Bible, adopted believer’s baptism and became known as Baptists. Meeting usually in houses or barns the religious and political conditions (for example that led to the Pilgrim Fathers emigrating to the New World) made prominent buildings illegal and impossible.\nToleration improved over two centuries and by the end of the Victorian era non-conformist churches, including Baptists were both numerous and influential in many communities, not least in North London."

                "With the acceptability and influence of the Free Churches came the opportunity and finance to build ‘church-like’ chapels.  Muswell Hill Baptist Church is one of many examples of the new status of non-conformity in late Victorian and Edwardian England.  It is as unmistakeably a ‘church’ as the parish church would be.",
                "It was commissioned by the London Baptist Association for the new suburb.  Baptists were already meeting in a nearby school.  The land was given by one of Muswell Hill’s key developers, James Edmondson – it is understood land was originally offered lower down Dukes Avenue but more central land was requested and granted.",
                "Baptist Churches are locally governed and funded so it was the congregation's responsibility to raise the funds and loans to build the chapel.  (Such was the eventual expense that an early minister had to resign the pastorate when the church lacked the funds to pay him due to the debt.)"

Baines was prolific as an architect of the fast-developing chapels, particularly in his native Lancashire and in London where he became established.  About 100 of his non-conformist chapels remain in use.  They are varied but share certain features.",
                "A Baines chapel is typically light with large windows.  The general layout emphasises the centrality of preaching (and congregational singing) and often creates a sense of space with high ceilings.  Many small decorative features enhance the general plainness and simplicity, in keeping with the Edwardian taste."
