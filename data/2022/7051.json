                "It has a hipped slate roof, portico, wooden bell tower, open belfry and cupola.",
                "Off what remains of the original carriage drive is the entrance to the crypt, built into what looks like a tomb.",
                "The church is a rectangular building, constructed of brick and faced with Portland stone, with a projecting chancel, nave, aisles and segmented headed windows on the ground floor.",
                "The boxed pews are a stunning feature of the the nave and Historic England described the church as “Excellent unrestored interior complete with original fittings – boxed pews, pulpit with sounding board, galleries and organ”.",
                "The monuments and impressive columns create a sense of grandness. The gallery, reached by two sets of steps, on either side of the organ, originally provided seating for the lower classes and the servants but today provide a raised vantage point to take in the stunning interior.",
                "The windows on the upper floor are round headed. The two round windows have original painted glass by Frances Eginton and there are a number of other notable stained glass windows.",
                "In the chancel there is a large funerary monument to Josiah Child. It is dated 1699 and is attributed to John Nost. The monument is of interest to visiting artists and those researching the East India Company. It was originally sited in the former church (as were the family remains), which stood approximately 50 yards to the south of the present church (and the floor of which can still be seen in the grounds).",
                "Behind the altar (which is reported to be a table from the former Wanstead House) there is a restored painting from the 17th century studio of Guercino.",
                "The Vestry contains images of Wanstead House (demolished in 1825, just 30 years after the church was built) which was sited at the south-eastern corner of the current graveyard, as well as a copy of the J M W Turner painting of the former church (built c.1520) and his sketch of the \"new\" church (he was apprenticed to the architect Thomas Hardwick)."

Sir John died in Italy in 1784, the story goes that the heart arrived after the tomb had been sealed for the last time, so the heart stands in a cut-crystal \"jar\", resting on the original font outside the Family Vault, with a plaque listing all the relatives therein."

The railings and gates to the north boundary of the church incorporate a \"kissing-gate\", and are Grade II Listed (Listed in 1979).",
