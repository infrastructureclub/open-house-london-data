                "The building which stands at 28 Bow Street was constructed in 1881 as a Magistrates' Court and Police Station.",
                "Built in a Graeco-Roman classical style, it was designed by the architect John Taylor, who is also responsible for designing the White Wing of the British Museum and the central hall of the National Gallery. Bow Street Magistrates Court was the first commission that Taylor undertook for the Office of Public Works. The building is clad in Portland Stone and white Suffolk brick. The lamps and railings, which still exist today, are cast-iron. Originally, the courtrooms and the police station were separated with a van entrance in the central courtyard of the building. Today, this courtyard is roofed and now contains the NoMad London Restaurant.",
                "The building was listed in 1973 as a Grade II listed structure and its façade is conserved as a result of this listing. The police station was closed in 1992 and in 2006, the court closed. In May 2021, both the NoMad Hotel and the Bow Street Police Museum opened within this historic building."

Subject to availability, there may also be an opportunity to take an exclusive look inside the building to visit the former Court No. 1, where many of Bow Street's infamous criminal cases were heard.",
