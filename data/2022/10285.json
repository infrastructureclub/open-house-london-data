Traces of past interventions show that there have been works around 1970 and then an extension in the 1990s. The latter had been built in steel, timber and glass. The original house was in need of extensive refurbishment of both the brick and timber structures."

We worked together to obtain permissions for a larger rear extension and a roof terrace. \nThe extended ground floor was imagined as a large open space with discrete elements hosting the technical items:\na cubic timber and glass box encloses the kitchen. A triangular prism encloses the stairs, storage, plant and WC. The rest of the ground floor is open space, expressing the tension between the cube and the prism. The only openings into space are a large glazed wall towards the garden, and a cylindrical roof light, that balances out all the composition. Here is where the client will play his music, with an eye on the sky."
