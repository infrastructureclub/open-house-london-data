We will consider how acts of mapping and mark-making also involve poetry and the performative, inviting participants to explore and envisage techniques of notation between writing and drawing. Through a series of short informal exercises participants will be encouraged to experiment in a supportive and friendly environment, with a focus on process rather than outcomes. All levels of experience are welcome. Refreshments & materials provided.",
