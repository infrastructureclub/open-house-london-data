Within the masterplan three individual teams of architects worked on the detail design of the buildings; Lanterna (by Lyndon Goode Architects), a stand-alone building facing on to a new public square comprising 16 dwellings and a ground floor restaurant; Monier Road (by Pitman Tozer Architects), three blocks comprising 71 homes and 7 workspace studios; and Neptune Wharf (by Haworth Tompkins), made up of 17 individual blocks forming three clusters, comprising 501 dwellings and 56 commercial and workspace units, opening up into the sequence of courtyards. A rigorous architectural language and material palette of brick and precast concrete has been applied across the site with variations in façade treatments to create a sense of diversity. All homes have private amenity in the form of terraces, balconies or winter gardens in the blocks which overlook the A12. Six of the blocks feature shared sheltered roof terraces, with planting and food growing allotments."
