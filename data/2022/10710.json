                "The project completely reinvents an existing 1920s semi-detached house through the addition of a single joinery element that brings functionality, warmth and tactility to a reimagined family space.",
                "As ever, our process began with our briefing game which explored how our clients live now and would like to live in the future. The brief identified a focus on improving connectivity, daylight and legibility of spaces. We identified the objectives could be met without the need to extend or radically alter the structure of the house. Instead of demolishing the existing generic bolt-on extension, nimtim chose to strip back and reconfigure the internal arrangement to save energy, cost and waste, minimising interventions whilst maximising outcomes."

                "The joinery showcases the clients’ collection of objects through fragments of arched alcoves, a motif throughout the new design. As well as storing books, cupboards for crockery and a crafting area, the joinery partitions conceal structural elements, large sliding doors, and includes glazed openings that allow playful glimpses to and from adjacent spaces.",
                "The new joinery element is warm, tactile and hardworking. It is designed to be interacted with, to serve the new open plan spaces it defines. It acts as fire separation to the upstairs ensuring a safe and compliant layout, and accommodates a range of services and functions freeing up the spaces around it to be more flexible and adaptable.",
                "A curved motif repeats throughout defining internal windows, doors and alcoves that display valued family objects. It stores books, includes cupboards for crockery and creates a craft- making area for the family. New partitions conceal structural elements, large sliding doors, and glazed openings that frame playful glimpses to and from adjacent spaces.",
                "We were able to work closely with the craftsman who made the joinery and explore how they would be made through sketching and discussion making it a genuine collaboration between designer and maker."

                "A limited pallet of inexpensive materials have been playfully arranged to celebrate the family’s daily lives. Value has been delivered in the composition rather than the expense of the material. By delivering the ambitions of the client brief through a single intervention, we were able to significantly reduce the programme, expense and environmental impact of the project.",
                "The material palette consists of sustainable sourced low VOC and formaldehyde-free plywood. This sat alongside traditional handmade terracotta tiles fired using by-products such as almond shells and olive pips instead of fossil fuels. Counter-tops are lightweight, hardwearing Formica with low embodied carbon compared to many alternatives.",
                "The result is a playful and unique new family home that provides a template for how we can deliver high quality architectural interventions with much reduced material use and environmental impact."
