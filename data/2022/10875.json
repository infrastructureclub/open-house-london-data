The Marshall Building designed by Grafton Architects is a seminal new addition to LSE’s campus. The large, multi-purpose building occupies a pivotal position at the southern corner of Lincoln’s Inn Fields. The site was originally occupied by Cancer Research UK. The original 1970 brick building was described by Historic England as ‘making a negative contribution to the character and appearance of the conservation areas, likely due to its substantial scale and architectural design, which lacks in visual interest to Lincoln's Inn Fields and presents fragmented series of closing elevations onto Portsmouth St and Portugal Street."
