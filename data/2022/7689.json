                "On High Path, Clarion is building new energy efficient homes designed by award-winning architects PRP. All existing residents are offered new homes on the estate. There will also be a range of environmental improvements, including extensive tree planting, an air source heat pump-based energy centre, underground refuse services and sustainable urban drainage.",
                "Built from the 1950s through the 1980s, the buildings no longer meet modern requirements. The plans to regenerate High Path were developed following an extensive programme of engagement with residents, ward councillors and other stakeholders. This culminated in an estate-wide test of opinion conducted by the Electoral Reform Society, where residents confirmed their support for the plans.",
                "Residents told Clarion they wanted a safer and more pedestrian-friendly neighbourhood, and to keep the community together. This principle of keeping the community in situ and intact whilst we remodel their neighbourhood and build new homes is central to Clarion’s approach to regeneration.",
                "At High Path we will provide:\n•\tOver 1,700 new high quality homes each with private outdoor space\n•\tEvery social rented property replaced and an increase in the social rented floor space\n•\tNew neighbourhood park, public square and play spaces\n•\tNew community centre\n•\tCommercial and retail space on Merton High Street and along the new park\n•\tOpportunities for new jobs"
