This wall had been completely blank from the 1950s until October 2021, when the sundial was opened by the Lady Mayoress.  The project was supported by the Corporation of London.  It now has a 10m x 10m east-facing sundial on it, which commemorates some of the national newspapers which used to be published in the neighbourhood when Fleet Street was the centre of the newspaper industry. “The Republican” was actually published on this site."
