                "London Guildhall University’s Women’s Library – formerly the Fawcett Library – had its roots in the suffragette movement and housed the largest collection of women’s history in the country. In 2001, on its seventy-fifth anniversary and as a result of a £4.2 million Lottery grant and other donations, it moved into new premises in Whitechapel, on the site of a derelict Victorian washhouse and laundry in Old Castle Street.\nIn 2013 the Women's Library transferred to the London School of Economics and the University (now London Metropolitan University) moved its Special Collections & Archives into the building.\nThese include the TUC Library Collections, The Archive of the Irish in Britain, The Frederick Parker Collection and Archive, The E&A Wates Archive, and The University Archive among others."

                "The architects appointed were Wright and Wright and they incorporated the façade of the former washhouse into their designs for the Library; a reminder of what life had been like for women in the past. The façade consisted of seven bays with simple rounded windows and was completely without ornament except for the word ‘Wash Houses’ and the date, ‘1846’, over the entrance.",
                "Adjusting their building to the scale of those around it, Wright and Wright opened up the interior to provide an airy space, with access to it at several levels from a series of large rooms set back from the washhouse wall. Control of the internal environment, both from the point of view of privacy and security and from considerations of energy conservation, figured largely throughout the design.",
                "The facilities included an exhibition hall, a seminar room, a reading room (the only symmetrical room in the building), archives, offices, a café, a friends’ room and a garden. The more public rooms are on the lower floors, with privacy and security being more important issues at the higher levels.",
                "The new building has a reinforced concrete frame clad in fair-faced brick and represents an investment in long-life, low maintenance, heavy-weight materials – stone, copper, steel, oak and glass. These materials, together with the form and mass of the building also contribute to environmental control, as do the following. Natural ventilation and daylight are used wherever possible. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is passively reduced. Exhibits are housed in well-sealed cases, so there is no need for mechanically-mediated humidity and air quality control. Reduction in energy consumption is achieved for example in the archives, where a vapour barrier separates them from the rest of the building, representing an energy saving of 80% over more conventional systems of care.",
                "Eight artists were invited to contribute to panels for the staircase, each one representing a well-known woman, however these were not included in the final building."
