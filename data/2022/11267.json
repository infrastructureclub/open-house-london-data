                "\"Holding Space\" is a term which demonstrates how acts of care – holding, listening, sharing – need plenty of room to be enjoyed and embodied. As a collective, the conversations we have shared over lunches, video calls and group chats, have coalesced around the idea of holding space.",
                "How do we make room for these acts of care? How do we make room for these acts in London specifically? How can we, in effect, ‘hold’ onto these spaces of respite and care, and ensure their durability in our rapidly transforming city? Is this loose and changeable meaning become a source of solidarity or provocation? What does holding space mean to you?",
                "We invite you to join PATCH Collective and Shumi Bose as we delve deep into this topic. Come and ask questions - there will be no wrong answers. Come and share your thoughts, share food, and share our company. With music provided late into the evening by Dubplate Pearl, this event is not to be missed."
