Despite Young’s closing in 2006, a small-scale brewery was maintained on site during the construction period to ensure that the development retained this legacy. Set within the Grade II* listed brewery complex is a new brewery, a heritage centre and accommodation for independent retailers, restaurants and exclusive loft-style apartments."

At ground level, the elevations are enlivened with retail units to create a vibrant and active environment, whilst above, the high-quality residential accommodation benefits from the more tranquil setting of private roof gardens."

The on-site Heritage Centre - entrance to which usually requires a paid ticket, but which is given free-of-charge to Open House visitors - contains many fascinating artefacts from the site's history.  The tour of the Heritage Centre will be led by one of the site's brewers."
