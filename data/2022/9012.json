                "Located in the heart of Hackney, East London, Yorkton Workshops is home to the award winning design studio, Pearson Lloyd, and their permanent studio, archive and workshop.\n \nDesigned by Pearson Lloyd in collaboration with Cassion Castle Architects, Yorkton Workshops itself is a building of two halves, Victorian and modern. Its Victorian section is intimate and domestic in scale, housing meeting and event spaces. Its more modern half is a 1990s factory building, built to replace an earlier fire-damaged structure, where the workshops and primary studio space are located. The two halves are intrinsically linked by an outdoor garden area, very much at the heart of the building and a bridge between old and new, that allow both structures to express themselves as distinct but connected. Yorkton Workshops has recently received the AJ Retrofit of the Year 2021 Award.",
                "Original features have been retained and, wherever possible, the building’s constituent materials have been reused and recycled, including bricks, timbers and steel. This is not only a more energy-efficient, low-carbon approach that responds to modern-day material scarcity, it also ensures the building conserves its historic industrial aesthetic and stays true to its local architectural context.",
                "The size and versatility of the space creates a unique opportunity to use the studio as, in effect, a laboratory for exploring new workplace models. As designers, Pearson Lloyd’s approach demands that products and spaces are iteratively developed in response to real-world physical interactions. Yorkton Workshops gives the studio the scope to ‘life-test’ new design concepts and workspace ideas at scale and in a real-world environment."

                "Unit 1 is a gallery space, comprising 1000 ft2 over two interconnected ground floor spaces with access to Yorkton Street and its own outdoor space. The gallery includes polished concrete floors, exposed timber ceilings and original brickwork and generous east and north facing windows. Facilities include a fully fitted kitchen, accessible toilet and independent alarm system.",
                "The entire building is available as a bookable location for photo shoots, videography and or launch events/meeting spaces. Yorkton Workshops industrial interior pairs domesticated materiality and spaces with functioning workplace environments. The breadth of the building makes it incredibly versatile for a range of brands."
