                "We met the clients a few years ago to discuss potential works for their flat. They had since moved to an end of terrace Victorian house in Camberwell. They still had their two cats and one child and a second coming! The house has deep, slightly wild gardens. The top floor was incredibly bright, thanks to a recent extension. The first floor was practical and straightforward, which suited the family. The ground floor was more problematic. The kitchen was constrained by a small side garden and dark because of a wide chimney stack on the rear facade. The ceiling was low, the storage was insufficient, and there was hardly any space for a little dining table. The large chimney breast also affected the relationship with the garden was not great. The rest of the ground floor was likewise fragmented and dark, with two additional rooms and a tight corridor between the entrance and the kitchen.",
                "â€‹Given their current and the coming family situation, the clients stressed the importance of having a utility space, generous storage (among other things, to fit an unfolded buggy!), and an ample dining kitchen area on the ground floor. They also wanted the house to feel airy and bright and improve the relationship with the garden."

                "The layout combines the advantages of the open plan and the fragmented plan, resulting in an eventful sequence of spaces that subtly evolve into one another. The sequence is accompanied by a continuous strip of joinery that guides the user from the entrance to the rear garden and provides coherence to the whole. The kitchen cabinets, the storage units, and the services areas are all incorporated in this long joinery snake as a critical interior feature. The diagonal wall of joinery has been created as multi-functional, the cut thoughts allow dappled light to penetrate through, with shelving for the owners to showcase their art and personality. The relation between the entrance, front room and rear kitchen-dining area is resolved through an angled, dynamic room that serves as the pivot for the whole project.",
                "Neutral colour pallet is used for the interior, with a fresh mint green highlight, to work with the beautiful patina of the wood in the joinery and parquet flooring and connect with the views over the deep garden.",
                "To bring a new relationship between the house and the garden, we introduced extensive glazing across the rear of the property, framing the garden and bringing in natural daylight. Additional skylights are placed at the junction of the side extension, drawing light deep into the home."
