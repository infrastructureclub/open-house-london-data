                "The retrofit of two vacant railway arches in the Low Line in Southwark is an initiative by the Low Line Partners to reinvigorate these redundant spaces with new uses, which serve the local community as well as providing facilities for local businesses.",
                "The retrofit provides long-term flexibility with functions including; last mile deliveries; cycle hub and shower facilities; flexible community space; and a performance and exhibition space.",
                "TDO’s design placed re-purposed Nissen sheds within the arches, allowing the atmospheric and generous vaulted spaces under the arches to be fully appreciated, whilst accommodating new uses. The projects have provided self-contained, demountable, reusable enclosures that can move to new arches reducing future capital outlay, allowing cost savings to be passed on to the communities they serve.",
                "The practice's interest in railway arches began with their own studio, a plywood and steel project a short walk from the Low Line arches."

                "Our design approach for the Low Line arches developed from our fascination with the power of railway arch spaces. In contrast to typical buildings they are leftover, remaining spaces; voids created by a function happening overhead.",
                "We moved out studio into a railway arch at 80 Great Suffolk Street and started to explore this in our design for the fit out by pulling it away from the perimeter walls, and introducing a large double height cut back space at the entrance. The intention was to allow for an appreciation of the arch space as a whole, rather than divide it up.",
                "The fit-out is a plywood insertion much like a large, intricate piece of joinery or oversized furniture, supported from a lattice of primer-red steelwork.",
                "Located under the line into Blackfriars station, the arch was bombed in WW2. Network Rail repaired the arch with concrete and steel, leaving a white metal waterproofed shell with six metre high exposed steel lattice support structure.",
                "The design retains the red steel and white sheet metal waterproofing as an exposed finish. The new mezzanine workspace is a face finished plywood insertion. It hangs from the existing steelwork: borrowing from the industrial nature of the space to create a contemporary, contextual architecture studio."

                "Our proposals for the Low Line arches responded to a brief for sustainable, low cost, demountable, reusable proposals that celebrate the arches.",
                "We continued our exploration of the power of the remaining space under the railways and pushed the concept further by proposing component based structures that could be assembled and dissembled without interfering with the arches.",
                "In 2014 we built a temporary gallery space on a multi-storey car park in Peckham by re-purposing corrugated galvanised agricultural water storage tanks. For the Low Line arches we proposed a similar system: Nissen sheds. The sheds are low tech, rapidly assembled buildings. The corrugated steel contrasts the Victorian brickwork, while the arched shape echoes the form of the arches. The sheds create spaces within spaces and allow an appreciation of the power of the original railway arch.",
                "The arches at Ewer St deliver a cycle hub and sustainable support services for local businesses including a last mile cycle delivery centre."

            "paragraphs": [
                "The brief for the Low Line arches project called for several different uses to be housed in different arches. By contrast to Ewer Street, which accommodates more industrial and functional uses, at Redcross Way the space was to be a flexible community space for performances, exhibitions, meetings, and any number of other functions for the surrounding community. The brief therefore tested the adaptability and robustness of the Nissen shed concept.",
                "At Redcross Way we created a single, large space with overhead servicing: heating, ventilation, power supplies for stage lights etc. The shed is scaled down in size from the arch to create an entrance corridor/lobby. This space gives views over the shed to the original vaulting brickwork.",
                "As with Ewer Street, the shed is raised on concrete feet. These feet perform two functions: they anchor the sheds; and they raise them up so the curved form does not result in any loss of usable area as compared with a standard 'box shaped' room.",
                "At both Ewer Street and Redcross Way the space around the sheds is used for corridors and distribution of services (lighting, power, data, rainwater collection etc). This is celebrated rather than concealed by mounting them on cantilevering arms projecting into the spaces."
