                "From a dark and almost windowless basement emerged a bright, double-height family space filled with daylight and colour. The garden is immediately outside the large up-and-over window of the kitchen extension. \nAn opening in the floor above created a link between the formal upper lounge to the family space below, via a mezzanine with a workstation. \nThe double-height space, while small in plan, creates an effect of generosity and visual relief where it is least expected on the lower ground of an otherwise very compact house. It demonstrates how not every space needs to be big but if selected elements are celebrated a sense of space can be achieved that hits above its weight.\nThe original staircase has been retained and still works as the spine of the Victorian house preserving the connections throughout the 3 levels. \nIn order to make the narrow spaces to work we had to be more creative to make sure all the spaces were architecturally interesting as well as functional. Fitted furniture played a key role in arranging the spaces efficiently while keeping them uncluttered."

The workstation at the middle floor is located on the mezzanine, connected to both lounge at the front and the kitchen below, allowing work without distractions while getting a sense of family life around. Felix's art studio has been moved from the lower ground to the back - it is smaller than before but now has views of the garden while providing daylight from the right (Felix is left-handed!). This work place can be fully separated by a sliding glass door to provide a quiet space for concentrated creative work. Both work spaces have been located specifically within the property without becoming the main focus of the house (which remains the kitchen downstairs).\nThe daughter’s bedroom was fitted with a bespoke shelving wall which integrates the third workstation, meant to last beyond school days. \nDuring the recent restrictions all three have worked in the house extensively and happily – a great test of the design provisions!"

                "The key environmental focus was to create a bright home within a dark semi-submerged house. The new glass extension brings in daylight deep into the lower ground floor and the double height space helps spreading the light further. This way, the lower ground floor became the most attractive space to be in, without the need for artificial lighting. The benefits are not just to the emissions balance but also to the mental health of the family who can now positively enjoy the spaces on all floors.\nThe carbon footprint for this project was kept low, as retaining most of the existing building and only adding a small infill extension prolongs the lifecycle of the existing building without adding much new material. The embodied carbon for the new elements and refurbishment works is therefore on a low level in relation to the entire house. Upgrading the heating system reduced the operational carbon emissions as well. \nThe choice of materials was steered by the aim to create a sustainable and comfortable home: Timber was the main material used for flooring and the new fittings throughout the project."
