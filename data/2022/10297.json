                "The walk examines the meaning and validity of such memorials in public spaces, as well as discussing their artistic merit, often a subject for debate in itself. It also aims to show how controversy over iconic symbolism is not just a recent phenomenon.",
                "In addition, the walk takes in some of the capital's most historic buildings such as Big Ben, Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey.",
                "Harry said: “Some argue that today’s statue wars are a reflection of modern identity politics but in truth, controversy over statues is nothing new. Indeed, battle lines can stretch back centuries.”",
                "Molloy added: “Participants will of course form their own opinions, but whatever your position, we hope to put the debate into some context, and at the very least, offer a fascinating and enjoyable stroll through the heart of London.”"
