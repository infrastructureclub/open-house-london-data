                "By 1654 a small open-air fruit-and-vegetable market had developed on the south side of the fashionable Covent Garden square in London. Gradually, both the market and the surrounding area fell into disrepute, as taverns, theatres, coffee-houses and brothels opened up. An Act of Parliament was drawn up to control the area, and Charles Fowler's neo-classical building was erected in 1830 to cover and help organise the market. The market grew and further buildings were added: the Floral Hall, Charter Market, and in 1904 the Jubilee Market running the length of Tavistock Street, named after the then Duke of Bedford, Marquess of Tavistock. We see the building as it stands today, a solid rectangular structure standing next to the London Transport Museum. After a major renovation of the Jubilee Market itself, beginning in 1985 and lasting 2 years, it was re opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 5th August 1987, as commemorated by a stone  plaque in the façade of the market."

With a wide range of food outlets, you can enjoy your trip to Jubilee Market with choices from traditional English breakfasts served all day at Peter's Snack Bar, German hot dogs, Crepes and ice creams, smoothies, and authentic Italian food from Prima Sapori, a family run restaurant within the market walls. Jubilee Market also has a bureau de change and a Box Office ticketing agency within its walls. It is instantly recognizable with its exciting atmosphere, flags, brass signage and commemorative bunting and lively family friendly atmosphere."

Its dedication and strength of purpose were instrumental in securing the future of the market.",

The bronze relief \"Fruit Porter Bronze\", was unveiled October 2006 by the Mayor of Westminster.

The famous Academy Award winning song was sung by Doris Day in the Hitchcock film The Man who Knew Too Much (1956)."
