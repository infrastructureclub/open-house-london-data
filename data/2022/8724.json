                "In its medieval form, the church was mainly a Perpendicular structure, and because it was sited next to the Archbishop of Canterbury's Palace, the building was made impressive through the money and influence of Archbishops Chichele and Courtney.",
                "The church was severely damaged by fire in 1867, following which only the tower, south porch and outer walls remained.  It was rebuilt, incorporating the existing remains and essentially to the same design as the old church, under the direction of Sir George Gilbert Scott, and was re-consecrated in 1870. There is a brass plaque just inside the entrance which lists the vicars through the years, the earliest being Elfsie in 960 AD."

Jasper Latham, the sculptor who worked with Christopher Wren on rebuilding St Paul's cathedral designed and created the Sheldon tomb.\n \nTwo memorials reveal Croydon's link with the American War of Independence. In the Lady Chapel there is a brass to Thomas Hutchinson, the last Colonial Governor of Massachusetts.

Two carved soldiers stand on eternal duty on either side: one a private, the other an officer. Above them, on the top of the wooden screen stand the four patron saints for each country in the United Kingdom.",
