            "paragraphs": [
                "Launched in 2008, Applecart was founded by Peter Moreton and Phil Summers. The company began by telling stories to a regular monthly audience at the White Hart Pub in Whitechapel, London. The creative duo then toured to various venues, pubs, theatres and universities around the country. Applecart also began to extend its storytelling onto the screen, making numerous short films and documentaries. Some of these can still be found over on our Vimeo.",
                "In 2012 Applecart moved into our first premises, a Victorian Methodist presbytery and school house in Tower Hamlets, where we worked alongside local artists and performers, building up community networks and relationships in the area. Seeing the potential the space had to be a hub for the creative arts, we decided to open as a venue for storytelling. In 2014 Applecart opened The Old School Room, with studio and rehearsal space for artists, theatre practitioners, writers and creatives. In 2016 Applecart closed The Old School Room and moved to bigger premises in Newham.",
                "In January 2017 the organisation took over the Harold Road Community Centre in Upton Park, saving the building from closure and demolition. The very first Applecart Café  was opened in early 2017 and we developed and opened The Littlewood Theatre by the Spring, alongside three rehearsal spaces and artist studios and community offices. The Harold Road Centre had become Applecart Arts, a community space to share stories, nurture creative talent, see excellent art and performance that engaged and represented the local community as well the wider creative community. Check out some of our highlights here.",
                "We’re excited for what the future holds in the next phase of Applecart Arts as we redevelop our new building, the Passmore Edwards Building, and we can wait for you to join us on this journey."
