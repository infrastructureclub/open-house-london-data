                "Pitzhanger Manor was designed by Sir John Soane (1753-1837) one of England's greatest architects. He bought the Pitzhanger site in 1800 in the hope of creating a showcase for his collection and his talents, and a family home for a dynasty of architects, starting with his young sons. In 1810, when his sons proved a disappointment, Soane sold Pitzhanger and moved his library and art collection to his London home in Lincoln’s Inn Fields.",
