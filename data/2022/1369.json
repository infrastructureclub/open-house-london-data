                "Pitzhanger Manor was designed by Sir John Soane (1753-1837) one of England's greatest architects. He bought the Pitzhanger site in 1800 in the hope of creating a showcase for his collection and his talents, and a family home for a dynasty of architects, starting with his young sons. In 1810, when his sons proved a disappointment, Soane sold Pitzhanger and moved his library and art collection to his London home in Lincoln’s Inn Fields.",
                "The house stayed in private hands till it was sold in 1901 to Ealing District Council. The building stands in Walpole Park which was formerly the ornamental gardens and parkland to the house, designed for Soane by John Haverfield in 1800."
