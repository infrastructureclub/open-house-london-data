People who're alive and thus able to question and be questioned.\nMarcia Rigg is a living civil rights campaigner who we felt should be celebrated for her work bringing scrutiny on police conduct and retaining focus on the relationship between police and the Black community. - She offers a role model who we rarely see venerated in our public spaces, a strong black women, rather than another dead 'great white man', and like history she is not set in stone, she is continuing to fight for change and justice.\nMarcia's brother Sean Rigg died in Police custody in 2008, after being arrested and held face down in a prone position for 8 mins, not too dissimilar to George Floyd. Marcia returns to the square every year placing flowers on what has become known as the 'memorial tree'. Her AR-statue is in dialogue with this place, she stands offering flowers as an act of love in one hand and  the other holds vigil candle in a fist, a sign of black solidarity and resilience.\nSituated in the square in front of Brixton Police station, her statue also serves to catalyse progressive conversations between the MET and Brixton's Community. Whilst it is a challenging reminder for the MET, it is also one they have chosen to support and embrace.",
