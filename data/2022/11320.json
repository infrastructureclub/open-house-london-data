Its headwaters are two streams on Hampstead Heath, each of which was dammed into a series of ponds. The waters flow 6km from the ponds and become part of London's sewer network designed by Joseph Bazalgette. The river gives its name to Fleet Street, the eastern end of which is at what was the crossing over the river known as Fleet Bridge, and is now the site of Ludgate Circus.",
