Because it’s all pay-as-you-go, our 550+ micro, small, and medium businesses benefit from variable overheads and have no need to risk capital in assets or liabilities. Sharing resources means they are affordable, accessible, and flexible—it promotes a dynamic economy between users and being amongst peers is just much more fun anyway.",
