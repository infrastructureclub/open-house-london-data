                "Stockwell Garage opened on Wednesday 2 April 1952. Designed by London Transport’s own team, in partnership with Adie Button and Partners, the building cost £450,000 (an estimated £14million in 2022) and its main feature is a spectacular reinforced concrete barrel-vaulted roof, 392 feet long by 194 feet wide. At the time it was the largest unsupported area under one roof in Europe and as a result there is an uninterrupted floor space of 73,350 square feet – enough to accommodate 200 buses.",
                "The building was granted Grade II* listed status in 1988, reflecting its post-war architecture and engineering importance and it remains the only operational bus garage in the country with such a status. Writer and local resident Will Self said of Stockwell Garage in 2007: “It’s a lovely building – sinuous, curved, organic. I could live in it for a year”.",
                "Visitors often gaze up and marvel at the cathedral like attributes of this amazing facility. A building designed to the highest standards of the day to carry out an everyday function – providing a roof over a fleet of buses.",
                "185 buses are based at Stockwell Garage today. The majority are double-deck, and the large maintenance facility (there are ten pits) also acts as a service centre for other Go-Ahead London garages. Stockwell is a big local employer, with over 600 personnel. The majority are drivers, along with engineers, administrators, supervisors, service controllers and managers. The garage is open 24 hours a day, 364 days a year.",
