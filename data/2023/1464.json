The foundation stone was laid by Lord Howard de Walden on 28 June 1933.",
                "In 1970, on the recommendation of the Historic Buildings Council, the RIBA building was listed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government as a Grade II building of architectural and historic importance, one of the very first examples of 'modern architecture' to be so recognised.",
                "The six-storey building is faced in Portland Stone. The sculpted figures on the Portland Place front depict the spirit of man and woman as the creative forces of architecture. Along the Weymouth Street elevation, above the third-storey window line, are five relief figures, depicting a painter, a sculptor, an architect (Sir Christopher Wren), an engineer and a working man. The interior of the building is finely detailed in a variety of materials."
