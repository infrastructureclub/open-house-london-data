Two industrial era chimneys were carefully dismantled when construction began, taken away for cleaning and have now been rebuilt in their original footprint using the same bricks. Subtle nods to the site's history can be found throughout, from the materials and colour pallets of new buildings, to the naming of streets and yards. The industries that have operated here throughout history include textile and ink manufacturing, sugar refinery, soap makers and Gin distillery."

Reuse, reduce, recycle has always been one of their mottos, and for that reason a lot of the decor, furniture and construction materials have been upcycled. \nJoin Jim & Tonic for tours of the gin distillery and guided tasting sessions, as well as music, fun and festivities throughout the day."
