Coupled with its pedestrian walkways separated from road traffic by the modernist 'streets in the sky' aesthetic, this makes Thamesmead the perfect location to explore by bike. Hailed in the 1960s as 'The Town of the 21st Century' you'll discover all about this utopian housing project built on soggy marshland. It was meant to house 60,000 Londoners desperately in need of decent housing following World War II. But by the 1970s the plan was faltering as an era of adventurous planning and public housing drew to an end."

There you'll find out about one of the most ambitious public works of modern times: London's sewer system."

At the other end of town, a DLR river crossing might unlock the last section of undeveloped riverside land in London, creating the potential for thousands of new homes. But with these plans has come redevelpoment - and large areas of the original brutalist estates are coming down to make way for new flats."
