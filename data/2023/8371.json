                "Designed by Philip Bottomley & Colin Lucas, Westbury Estate is situated between Wandsworth Road and the Southern railway line to Victoria. Though known for its two 62m towers, Amesbury and Durrington, it is designed with a mix of two - storey & four - storey maisonettes set in an open grassed landscape and mature trees. Approved by the LCC in 1963, it was completed by the GLC in 1967.",
                "Despite having a strong sense of community and low crime rate, Lambeth Council decided to demolish Westbury Estate. Together with the other six estates in Lambeth threatened with demolition, the residents campaigned to save their homes and community against a concerted effort to demoralise and decant the residents from the area."

                "Philip Bottomley was born in Yorkshire in 1927, grew up in Sevenoaks, Kent and joined the Navy at the end of the War. On his father's insistence he became an architect, began his training and joined the London County Council.",
                "At the time when Bottomley joined, there were over 600 architects working at the LCC making it one of the largest architectural offices in the world. He was placed under the guidance of Colin Lucas and was given his first job as a Grade 3 architect working with two technical assistants Martin Richardson and Tom Kay for a scheme in Kilner Street, Stepney.",
                "Lucas then handed Bottomley his next job at Brandram's Works in the Canada Estate, Rotherithe in 1959. A former  chemical works, the factory was demolished and plans for the estate were approved by Bermondsey Metropolitan Borough Council in 1962 built by Tersons and completed in 1964.",
                "Bottomley was influenced by the work of Frank Lloyd Wright, especially Taliesin East and the Robie House. He enjoyed the process of drawing and organically working through problems, refining the building as it developed. He relished his ongoing battles with quantity surveyors who often black marked his plans and retracted his usable roof terraces due to cost.",
                "Ward never interfered with his projects. But when the team came up with the idea of putting two bed flats per floor, he said if it seems like a good idea why not do it! He was then asked to repeat this typology on other sites including the one in Battersea."
