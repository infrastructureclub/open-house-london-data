                "We then have the chance to see Phoenix Farm, an award-winning community garden. It provides access to a green space for local residents, particularly important for those who do not have access to private gardens.",
                "We'll move on to the White City Estate, the London County Council's most ambitious interwar dense housing estate, built between the 1930s and 1950s. When it opened the estate was praised for its high quality self-contained flats.",
                "On the estate, we'll also see Malabar Court, a small 1960s system-built brutalist block designed by Alina and Noel Moffett. It has a very different approach to density - a design of ascending hexagons, reportedly inspired by the Giants' Causeway in Northern Ireland.",
                "We'll end up at the Wood Lane Estate, Darbourne and Darke's 1970s small  dense low-rise estate, built in brick. Emphasis on privacy is expressed through each home having its front door at pedestrian level and an internal network of courts and pathways."
