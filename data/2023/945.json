Constructed of Kentish Rag with Bath stone courses and quoins, it presents a robust solidity and the 150 ft massive pyramidal spire is in smooth stone above the bright red roof tiles, the textured walls and the chequered gable of the porch.",
                "Mrs Georgiana Hannah Twells commissioned the church from William Butterfield, as a monument to her husband Philip Twells of Chase Side House, a banker and MP for the City of London. The foundation stone was laid in 1881 and the church was consecrated two years later. At this time the suburb was developing rapidly with the railway reaching Enfield Chase and there was a need for a substantial church serving the surrounding villas and smaller houses."

The stained glass is of a consistently high quality and includes a touching WW1 memorial in the north aisle. The traceried screen added in1898 at the chancel has been moved to the west end of the nave.",

These are by Charles Buckeridge (1897) and those on the side walls by N H Westlake (1899). These were restored by Hirsh Conservation in 2012 with the aid of part monies from the Lottery.",
