Constructed in 1865 to provide access to the Crystal Palace from the High Level Railway Station it is now listed Grade II* but, after more than 50 years as a ruined structure, the Subway was in a very poor condition until the current restoration works commenced.",
                "Located at the intersection of five London boroughs, the Grade II* Crystal Palace Subway first opened in 1865 to provide access to the Crystal Palace from the High-Level Station. The Subway is one of the last remaining features of the Crystal Palace following the 1936 fire, when the Victorian roof that covered the Subway’s East Courtyard was destroyed. Nevertheless, the Subway has been utilised by the community as a WW2 air-raid shelter and occasional event space.  In 2013, a small steering group of volunteers and sponsors was formed to champion the restoration of the site, formally constituted as the Friends of Crystal Palace Subway. In 2022, the Council appointed specialist contractor DBR to undertake the Subway Restoration Project."

Traditional materials and techniques are being used throughout. Where the original bricks were missing entirely, or were structurally unsound, they have been replaced with carefully sourced new or salvaged bricks. The missing steps are being replaced in new York stone. The north wall of the courtyard was leaning so badly that it had to be entirely reconstructed although, even then, it was possible to save the Victorian retaining wall that stood behind it. The new roof has been designed to create a single column-free space internally but its internal structural form acknowledges the double pitches of the original roof."
