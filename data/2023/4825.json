                "The building was described by Pevsner as “one of the most eccentric efforts anywhere at a do-it-yourself free-style”. It displays influences from a range of architectural styles and demonstrates Stanley’s talent for solving the practical problems presented by the site. Stanley recognized the need for a venue dedicated to the performing and visual arts since the available public rooms in South Norwood were already proving inadequate by the end of the 19th century. When the Stanley Halls opened, they provided increased opportunities for local young musicians such as William Hurlstone and Samuel Coleridge Taylor, and artists such as Lily Martin, to establish themselves: a tradition that continues today."
