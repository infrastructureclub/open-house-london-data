The building is a nine-storey office development located in the heart of the City, adjacent to the Bank of England and within the Bank conservation area. ING fitted out the building, which is home to both a modern British art collection and the Baring Archive.",

The upper floors set back as the building rises in a series of accessible external terraces. An element of the ground floor of the development has been designed for retail use to address the existing retail cluster on Telegraph Street."
