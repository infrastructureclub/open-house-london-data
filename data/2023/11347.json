We are progressive, inclusive and enjoy collaborating with diverse communities to create exciting spaces and neighbourhoods.  We like to work with local suppliers and manufacturers, and encourage a hands-on sustainable and pragmatic approach.\n​\nWe are also here to combat climate change and seek to inform and educate via a multitude of mediums.  Poroban is a signatory of Architects Declare and an advocate for buildings with a low carbon footprint. We are particularly interested in materials with low embodied energy, promoting timber and demountable construction, passive environmental control and supporting local skills. If buildings contribute to 40% of total UK greenhouse gas emissions, then we have big part in producing solutions to reduce our impact.\n​\nPoroban is a promoter of diversity in the construction sector and has committed to the Diverse Leaders Pledge.",
