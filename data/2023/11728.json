Rather than pour concrete which is environmentally problematic, screw piles were used for the foundations, and the walls, roof and floor structure are built from timber frame. Instead of specifying standard petrochemical insulation that is widely available for the studioâ€™s thermal envelope, the walls and roof were specified to be entirely breathable, using insulation made from both wood fibre and recycled denim from the fashion industry. There were also no plastic waterproofing membranes used in the build. There will be samples of the insulation products available and the architect will be on site to discuss their first hand experience using these materials and technologies."

They contain the ideas of capturing those immediate feelings of drama in a continuously changing landscape, and her work will be on display in the studio."
