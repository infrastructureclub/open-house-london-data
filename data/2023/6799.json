                "During December 2014, the floor boards of the Royal School of Needlework Embroidery Studio 2 were lifted to try to understand why a dip had occurred in the floor. It was found that the supporting sleeper walls had a number of stacked supports, which were beginning to destabilise and the short walls themselves were sinking into what, 500 years ago, had been the east moat of the Palace.",
                "The brick foundations that you can see in the picture are part of the 16th century Apartments that Henry VIII originally built for Anne Boleyn. Whilst the HCP team knew that remains of this type should be found in this area, the floor had not been lifted for a long time so these remains had never been exposed before.",
                "The very thick red brick wall would have formed the most easterly wall of the Palace overlooking the gardens and was constructed for Anne Boleyn in the early 1530s. The bay window appears to be a later addition and may represent a change in the original plan or part of the remodelling of the area for Jane Seymour.",
                "It is likely that the area of Studio 2 (from 1537) would have originally functioned as part of the Queen’s Wardrobe and on the first floor above would have been the Queen’s Withdrawing Room.",
                "The thin inner wall, within the bay window, appears to be some 16th century engineering works, probably aimed at stabilising the building (as this whole area was built in to the moat).",
                "This wall has been dated to between 1580-1610 from clay pipe evidence – the pipe found could be traced as being made by John Rosse in Kingston.",
                "All of these structures were demolished by Sir Christopher Wren at the end of the 17th century to make way for the magnificent Baroque palace in which you are standing today which William III and Mary II began to rebuild in 1689. But the main walls of Anne’s apartments were sound so the foundations of the Baroque palace are built into those of the Tudor palace."

From the most recent coronation, there will be images of work in progress and of some of the team who worked on it along with some of the sampling. This is a fascinating glimpse into how some of the amazing items seen on the day were created.\nSee the website www.royal-needlework.org.uk for more information."
