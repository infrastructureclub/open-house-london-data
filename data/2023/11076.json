The UK Health Security Agency (previously Public Health England) sits on the massive grounds to the old Colindale Hospital (originally called the Central London Sick Asylum District Infirmary). However, Colindale had a precursor to Public Health England up the street called the Government Lymph Establishment. Across from there was a branch of the British Library in the form of newspaper archives. Last, but not least, is the RAF Museum that takes up only a tiny bit of the 207-acre site of the London Aerodrome.",
