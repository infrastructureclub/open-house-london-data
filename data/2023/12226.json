                "Chancery House, on Chancery Lane, close to Lincoln’s Inn Fields, is a building with a fascinating history. The site of the historic Silver Vaults - used for the storage and sale of fine art and silverwork - was originally constructed from an abandoned post office and underground tunnel in 1885. The original building above ground was bombed during WWII and built in roughly its current form in the 1950s, salvaging some of the existing basement Silver Vaults.",
                "Architects DMFK redeveloped the existing building for clients The Office Group, transforming the site into a new flexible workspace featuring beautifully designed spaces including a fitness studio, rooftop terrace, courtyards, and a café. The building’s exterior was clad in WasteBasedBricks, which incorporate a minimum of 60 per cent of recycled building waste. An existing car park was converted to a landscaped, planted garden to improve biodiversity, wellbeing, and connections to nature for the building users. The interior design was carried out by Copenhagen based interiors house Norm who referenced the red bricks of the façade in the interior of the building."
