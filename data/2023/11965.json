Beginning at Pudding Mill Lane and  ending at Stratford station, discover industrial histories from porcelain to printing to perfume. Find out about some of the legacies of transport infrastructure that defined Stratford as a railway landscape. Learn about local communities and how these have been affected by changes to housing policy and development proposals. From Art Deco to contemporary art and sculpture, the Stratford Art and Culture trail interprets the art and architecture that you will see on the walk to explain change and appreciate how the past continues to contribute to Stratford’s current sense of place."
