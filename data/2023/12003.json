                "Stoke Newington was a medieval village surrounded by fields and woodland, and its proximity to London attracted many wealthy residents. By the 18th century when Clissold House was built, it was a well established commuter village. From about 1800 the area's development began to gather pace with estates subdivided and suburban villas built. The next 100 years saw the area's rapid growth and it's transformation from country village to London suburb. By 1850 a number of major roads were laid out, including by Thomas Cubitt, the Victorian developer of Belgravia, whose homes we will see. The area was still picturesque and filled with greenery but as the century progressed it became more middle class. By the end of the 19th century the wealthy were leaving and homes were being subdivided into tenements. Around this time, Clissold Park was saved by the new London County Council and opened as a public park, but this did not halt the social transformation of the area. By 1902, 20% of the population lived in poverty and the area had seen its first influx of migrants. After World War I overcrowding and poor quality homes led the first social housing to be built including the Lordship Estate which we will see, as well as private housing such as Clissold Court. The area was heavily bombed in World War II and saw further social housing built in the postwar period such as the Highbury Quadrant and Kings Crescent Estates, featured on this tour, well as many further waves of immigration. In recent years the area has become highly desirable and some estates have been transformed by Hackney Council."
