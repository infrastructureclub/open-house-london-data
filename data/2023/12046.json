                "The National Youth Theatre (NYT) has occupied its building on Holloway Road in North London since 1987. Originally a Mission Hall built in 1872 designed by George Truefitt, the building then was used as a People’s Picture Palace screening films and then became a furniture warehouse before returning to its public entertainment heritage with the NYT. In the 1900s the building sat opposite a 1000+ seat Music Hall and since the NYT’s arrival in 1987 we have carried on that mantle with our building hosting activity for thousands of young creative people alongside rehearsals for some of the biggest award-winning West End musicals. In 2020 the NYT acquired a 999-year lease on the building with support from Arts Council England to secure it as the long-term home for the charity. In order to make the building fit for the purposes of the company’s growing work in 2020 we began a major transformation of the building. Led by DSDHA, the ambitious redevelopment was designed to create a National Creative Production House for young people to develop their talent alongside professional rehearsals. The building is part of a growing creative campus on the Holloway Road, which also includes Costume and TV production companies."

Spaces throughout the building are currently full of workshops with young creatives from around the UK and are now available to hire. Email hires@nyt.org.uk for more information."
