No bookings are needed to attend a tour, time slots are assigned on a first come first served basis. Please arrive early to avoid any disappointment. Tour restrictions also apply. Please visit our website to find out more.",

                "The Southwark Integrated Waste Management Facility was built and is being operated by Veolia UK, as part of its 25 year PFI contract with Southwark Council. \n \nThe facility, which became operational in January 2012, is one of the most advanced in Europe. It has been designed to promote sustainable waste management and to accommodate the unique central London location.",
                "The facility comprises: \n· Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) \n· Mechanical Biological Treatment (MBT) facility \n· Public Household Waste, Reuse and Recycling Centre (HWRRC) \n· Waste transfer station\n· Recycling Discovery Centre for children\n· Waste collections depot \n· Vehicle workshop",
                "The MRF sorts one of the widest ranges of household recyclables in the UK, including difficult to recycle items such as Tetra Paks, aerosols and tubs. It can be reprogrammed to take account of future developments in packaging and materials, ensuring a more sustainable design – a first in Europe. Near Infrared (NIR) sorters are used extensively to reduce the human interface within the mechanical separation process, making the facility safer and more efficient than ever.",
                "The MBT treats black bag, traditionally non-recyclable waste. Using a unique combination of novel technologies, a new concept has been developed to mechanically separate recyclable materials (e.g. metals and plastics) from the general waste. These materials are sent for recycling, whilst the remaining general waste is biologically processed into a low carbon biomass fuel for energy recovery.  Some of this fuel is used at SELCHP to generate electricity for the national grid and heat, which is circulated to around 2,800 Southwark Council homes."
