This style, formerly known as Queen Anne, represents a breaking away from classicism with a return to the domestic architecture of William of Orange. Many features have been adapted but, as far as possible, the essential style is preserved as befits a Grade II listed building.",
                "The height of the rooms and the strength of the floors reflect their purpose for the printing school – printing machinery is extremely heavy – and the lithographic school, which is now the public reading room, can take one ton weight per square metre.",
                "There was also a gym which is now a printing workshop and a swimming pool. When the Institute was planned at the end of the 19th century, the intention was not just to create a printing school for local workers, but also to provide facilities to the local community. The baths would be open to the public and \"available for the use of the poorer classes\".",
                "The swimming pool – believed to be the first public pool in the area – remains in situ today underneath the stage of the Bridewell Theatre and the central skylight and viewing gallery can still be seen. The original towel laundry, where swimming costumes were hired, washed and dried, is also still in place in the theatre bar.",
                "This is a building with a practical purpose which, although the printing school left in the 1920s, still delivers its original aim of providing education and entertainment."

There is probably no place in the universe of the same size wherein so much printing is done” (British and Colonial Printer May 21, 1891).",

                "With the death of William Blades, Victorian printer and expert on Caxton and early printing, St Bride Foundation had the opportunity to acquire a private library devoted to the history of print, containing exceptionally rare books on the subject. The collection was given its own purpose-built, fireproof room, in which it still rests to this day, as part of St Bride's extensive library of print-related technical and academic works.",
