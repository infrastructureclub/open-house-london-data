Water acts as a theme for the architecture theme, connecting all aspects of the Gallery. The displays and the areas around each display have been shaped by the movement of water. Water has created a changeable space, one which people will continue to return to."

The white space of the main gallery is shaped by the continuous logic of the illuminated water drops that seamlessly connects the different areas. The array of glowing ‘pods’ builds the spine of the central space that is further defined with its final spiral move, which leads to the knowledge, research and and multi-media seating area next to the main reception.",
                "The bold spatial concepts of the unique display environments stand out as dark grey concrete in contrast with the white central spine of the Gallery. Their form has been sculpted as if by the properties of erosion combined with the functional considerations of the gallery to allow flexibility. The continuing variety within the five distinct bathroom areas evolves along the backbone of the main Gallery."
