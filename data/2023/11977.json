The area – now in the midst of a dramatic transformation under the GLA’s London-wide regeneration programme – has a history of trade, manufacturing, imperial power and economic decline, and we’ll look at how that legacy both shapes the built environment of today and is drawn on by its developers to give new residential developments on brownfield sites their own identities as neighbourhoods amid the planned tens of thousands of new homes in this part of Docklands."

Buildings of interest include Glenn Howells’ new Mulryan Centre for Dance, Wilkinson Eyre’s Crystal (now City Hall), CZWG’s Hoola Building and Mae’s Pinnacle House. Other sites of interest include the Greenwich Meridian line, East India Dock Basin nature reserve, the historic Stothert and Pitt cranes at Victoria Dock, the IFS Cloud cable car, and memorials to the Virginia Settlers of 1608 and the Brunner Mond explosion of 1917."
