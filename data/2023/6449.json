                "The combined buildings define the southern edge of Peninsula Square and act as a gateway leading south to the cable car and Central Park. A pair of curved glass pavilions, linked by a clear-span canopy, are inspired by geomagnetic lodestones which were used as early compasses enabling the great world voyages of discovery - the maritime heritage for which Greenwich is famous. The canopy soffit traces a ‘magnetic field’ pattern linking and creating a virtual forcefield between the poles of attraction.",
                "The pavilions contain a contemporary art gallery, offices, a cafe, restaurant, sky bar, charcuterie and marketing facilities. The 82m long patinated brass edge canopy - longer than the wing span of an Airbus A380 - is gently curved forming the last ‘ripple’ emanating from the geometry of the Dome and provides shelter for special artistic and community events as well as pop up markets."

Submarine cables, ships, iron, steel, linoleum, cement, bronze, copper and brass were all made on the Peninsula. Brass, copper and other metal combinations, in particular, have been incorporated where possible as well as steel and concrete.",
                "The high-performance, curved glass has been specified to create a rich interplay of transparency and reflective sparkle – depending on light conditions, location on the building and time of day. The glass specification responds to the environmental and functional requirements of its orientation and location. For example the interstitial solar control coating is predominantly in the southern facing glass with clearer glass to the north. The ground floor entrance areas of the cladding are specified to be very transparent to invite and welcome people in. The angle of the two principal facades both open onto and address Peninsula Square while also creating a dialogue between the building entrances under the canopy. Elsewhere the glass becomes highly reflective mirroring the surrounding landscape, sky and buildings and creating internal privacy."
