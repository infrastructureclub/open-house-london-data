A galvanised steel and timber staircase, elevated above the wharf’s wild zone, takes you down to the pontoon.

Freezing in winter, boiling in summer, she’s a perfect vantage point to spy on all the dramas of the canal and towpath. I once gave myself a concussion walking in to the cabin, so mind your head."

Wooden steps (which also function as storage drawers) descend into the galley/kitchen  of an open plan living area with a wood stove and sofa. The main cabin is divided from the sleeping area at the front of the boat by a bathroom cabin with a curved wall. The boat has five large bus-style windows plus two large (15”) portholes. In addition to the rear hatch entrance there is a side hatch and doors opening to the front deck."
