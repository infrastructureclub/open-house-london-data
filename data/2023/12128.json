The stage is constructed from unassuming objects which have been carefully placed together; a table, dining chairs and crockery, framing Shakeel’s meal. The scene is dramatized by a saturation of glass crystals, propelling us to view the staples of domestic life through an altered lens.",
                "Shakeel’s meticulous work expresses a subversive, witty dialogue through sculptural form and will explore and celebrate the gregariousness of the family table. Inanimate objects become the main players, an assemblage and modern day still life scene."
