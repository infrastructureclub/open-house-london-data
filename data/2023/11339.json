The garden had previously been a plain lawn with limited interest, but a considered redesign and new planting strategy will now provide seclusion and protection from the busy surrounding area, creating a more dynamic and varied space for the building’s users and passers-by ,to explore and move through.",

A large, reflective pool designed in collaboration with water feature specialist Andrew Ewing reflects the sky and surrounding historical environment, providing calm in the bustling heart of the City."
