                "Building Down / upside down: We couldn’t build up because of the surrounding cardens, and there are usually at least 6 of us, so we had to dig, but we kept the bedrooms on the lower floor so that the ‘public’spaces would have a better connection to the garden. This meant a lot of underpinning/foundations.",
                "Brutalist ‘honest’ construction: we feel that a building should express what it is made of, so all of that mass of material used to underpin and retain the surrounding ground needed to be expressed internally.\nHigh thermal Mass: having all of the mass of concrete expressed internally resulted a huge amount of thermal mass which informed the environmental strategy, one of thermal inertia.",
                "Passive Solar Gain: the house is arranged around one large internal south facing living space.  The tree provides critical shading in summer.",
                "Garden Spaces: we’ve created a series of sunken gardens carved out of the ground to ensure good natural light to all of the lower living spaces.",
