                "The house  at 10 Tollgate Drive was completed 1966 and is part of a development of  2 storey pyramid houses and bungalow Range houses that are cleverly juxtaposed that give a feeling of low density housing and a feel of privacy and exclusivity.\nThere are two developments Ferrings and Tollgate Drive and they are split between Gainsborough Court a seven storey residential block, it had been the intension originally to build more blocks rather than low rise housing, but the houses where felt more in keeping with the location and the lifestyle expectations of the 1960's!\nThe development was designed by Manfred Bresgen of the Russell Vernon Partnership, Manfred was also involved with the design of the Dulwich College's Christison Hall and other residential projects in Dulwich including Ling's Coppice.\nThe house from the original had been extended in the 1980s including filling the yard space between the house and the garage and filling part of the front garden. \nIn 2008 the house was further extended with basement with south facing light well, and it was completely refurbished to suit modern expectations and while maintaining the respect for the original clarity of design and spirit of the original."
