The original drill hall was finished in 1886 at 59 Buckingham Gate to a design by the Scottish architect John MacVicar Anderson.  Having suffered a century of use and war time damage during the blitz, the decision was made to re-build in a new location, close to the original, but retaining many of the architectural features of the old building, such as the three War Memorials, the original Portico and the late-Victorian wrought iron balconies and roof. \nThe current building was completed in 1988 and granted Grade 2 listed status by English Heritage in 2021."

After the Army Reserve unit moved locations in 2017 the building use has evolved to a mix of office rental, hospitality, conference and meeting space and the Regimental Museum."

                "Reasons for Designation:\n- Architectural interest:\n*for the innovative late-Victorian wrought iron roof structures and galleries restored from the original drill hall. \n*for its exteriors in a neo-Georgian style which references traditional drill hall design but with subtle use of post-modern elements to enliven the elevations. \n*for the high quality of the brickwork \n*for the three restored war memorials which are all of high-quality design and materials.\n*for the involvement of notable late C19th and C20th architectural practices,\nHistorical Interest: For its associations as the former Headquarters of the London Scottish Regiment, a Volunteer unit with a distinguished history, formed in 1859,  with close links to Westminster."
