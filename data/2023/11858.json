                "Originally built in 1871, Cody Dock was constructed by the Imperial Chemical Company for the purpose of unloading coal from barges that was used to produce coal gas (town gas) and distribute the factory’s many by-products, such as soap and the pigment Prussian Blue. The dock was later purchased by the Gaslight and Coke Company who also owned the Beckton gasworks which became the largest gasworks in Europe. After being taken over by British Gas, the dock and its associated factory buildings fell into decline from the late 1960’s with all production coming to a close in the early 1980’s. Cody Dock and the surrounding properties were taken over by the Docklands Development Corporation in the early 90’s and much of the surrounding land was parcelled off for redevelopment into the business parks that still remain today. The dock, however, was no longer seen as being viable and was blocked off, partially filled in and converted into a balancing lagoon for surface water run-off. In November 2009 the charity Gasworks Dock Partnership was formed by local residents as a not-for-profit organisation, to provide a community led regeneration vehicle with the aim of opening up public access to the Lower Lea River and restoring the dock."

The pavilion was designed as a lightweight timber structure with a butterfly roof, to demonstrate that plants growing and humans can happily co-exist in one space.",

They then developed designs for a visionary community space based on the initial research, suitable for the local context and site. This Live Project was initiated by Maria Kramer and supported by Corinna Dean.",
