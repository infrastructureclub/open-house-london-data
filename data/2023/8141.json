For over 900 years, the church has been at the centre of faith and community in Walthamstow. Every generation has updated the interior to suit the changing needs of the Church.",

He was a significant benefactor of the church and local community, where adjacent almshouses and a nearby local sixth form college still bear his name. There are also two palimpsest brasses.\nThe earliest stone monument was erected in 1601 by Sir Edward Stanley in memory of his wife, Lady Lucy. The sculptor is thought to be William Cure II, later Master Mason to King James I.\nThe Merry monument of 1633 was intended by Sir Thomas Merry (a prominent Royalist) as a joint memorial to his wife\nand himself; the sculptor was Nicholas Stone, Master\nMason to King Charles I, and the verses are said to have been written by Sir William Davenant the Royalist poet.\nThe Trafford monument, erected in 1689, is the largest and most imposing monument in the church and is in the style of Grinling Gibbons.\nDesigned by James Humphries Hogan, the five lancet East Window, a memorial to Sydney Harris, dates from 1939 and is the work of James Powell & Sons (Whitefriars) Glassworks.",
