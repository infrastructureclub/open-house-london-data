Gradually, the Sikh community through donations acquired adjoining land and built the Main Gurdwara building that was opened in November 1992. The Gurdwara offers more than a hundred services that are free. This led to the expansion of our estate with the New Complex that was opened by the late HM Queen Elizabeth in October 2004.",

The New Complex houses a Community Centre, an Education Centre, a Library and an Exhibition Hall."
