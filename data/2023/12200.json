That walk forms the basis of one of the chapters from his latest book, 'Iconicon: A Journey Around the Landmark Buildings of Contemporary Britain'.",
                "This walking tour retraces his steps on a fun and informative architectural exploration of an overlooked suburban centre, and tells the story of the last few decades of Britain through the urban design, pop culture and social history of a town caught on the cusp of sitcom punchline and hipster cool. The route will take in the celebrated Threepenny Bit building, the ghosts of modern towers, traces of Medieval, Victorian and Art Deco Croydon, long-disappeared theatres and cinemas, the Fairfield Halls arts centre and more."
