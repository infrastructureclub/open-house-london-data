                "Now a modern suburb within the London Borough of Hillingdon, Eastcote has a centuries-stretched history.  As part of Ruislip, the very first mentions about the area was in the Domesday Book in 1086 and in the mid-thirteenth century.  Later, in 1754, Eastcote is mentioned in the documents as Ascott. \nBack then, this area was an agricultural one, with rich fields, ponds and many greeneries, so the main occupation of the people living here was farming. The 1841 census registered 525 people living in Eastcote with 17 farmers and 62 agricultural labourers. Other occupations were carpenters, bricklayers, sawyers and men who take care of the woods.  Some of the farm buildings, barns and cottages survived and now are converted in family houses. \nThe heart of Eastcote Village was  in between the four main roads, still here today, Eastcote High Road -Wiltshire Lane - Fore Street - Field End Road.  After first opening the Eastcote halt,  in May 1906, the centre moved South, with shops parade being built in the '20s on Field End Road. \nToday, Field End Road is known as High Street, providing  residents general stores, restaurants, pharmacies and grocery shops."

                "At 50 Field End Road still stands Tudor Lodge, a newly refurbished hotel. But its history starts in 16th Century when it is mentioned that the site was occupied. Initially a farmhouse with two enclosures linked together, the building itself had changed its name many times for the past two hundred years and it is known now as Tudor Hotel.\n In 1913 - 1914, Benjamin J. Hall and his wife owned and lived in the house and they offered to turn it  into a hospital for the VAD, Women's Voluntary Aid Detachment. Despite some difficulties related to the function of the hospital, by early days of November 1914 the site was ready and equipped to use.  In April 1915, the hospital became an independent medical unit with Mrs. Hall as its Commandant. Till September 1916, the hospital reached a number of 40 beds and it is known that more than 400 people were treated here and a number of 88 surgeries were performed.",
                "Highgrove House\nAn impressive Georgian house, with an exceptional history, still standing in the grounds of Highgrove Wood. Initially erected in 1750, the building was rebuilt based on Edward Prior's plans in 1881, after a devastating fire on the night of 16th November 1879. One of Prior's early commissions, drawings of Highgrove House were exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1882. At the time of the fire, the building was occupied by Sir Hugh Hume-Campbell and Lady Juliana Rebecca Hume-Campbell.  \nLater, in October 1978, a fire ruined the building, but it wasn't destructive. The authorities decided to rebuilt Highgrove, following Prior's plans. Restorations finished in 1980."
