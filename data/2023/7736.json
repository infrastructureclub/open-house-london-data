                "21 Portland Place is an 18th century, Grade II* listed building, originally built on the 'Grandest Street in London'.",
                "Portland Place was built between 1776 - 1778, designed by two of the leading architects of the time, brothers Robert and James Adam. It was originally designed as a series of private palaces, though the architects quickly acknowledged that this was a little ambitious and the residences became more modest terraces. The construction of this terrace, of which number 21 is the centrepiece, began in approximately 1776 and was completed around 1778.",
                "21 Portland Place contains a wealth of attractive features which are typical of the neoclassical Adam style. Particularly fine examples are the ceilings of the main rooms, the Portex and the Intavent Suite, which incorporate ornate mouldings and paintings into their design.",
                "Notable residents have included Alexander Macmillan (1818-1896) who founded the Macmillan publishing house, and Sir Arthur Pearson who founded the charity St Dunstan's, now known as Blind Veterans UK.",
                "The house was bought by the Association of Anaesthetists in 2002. It is home to the Anaesthesia Heritage Centre which contains the Associations’ archives, the Anaesthesia Museum and a rare book collection and is open to everyone."

                "Museum visitors can explore the history of anaesthesia, resuscitation and pain relief. The museum also features an 'operating theatre' which allows visitors to listen to aural recordings, including some oral histories, about anaesthetic equipment, procedures and developments.",
                "You can explore the museum’s temporary exhibition Going Viral: Contagion, Pestilence and Pandemics, and discover anaesthetists’ leading role in improvements to patient care and ground-breaking discoveries during the epidemics and pandemics of the last 180 years."
