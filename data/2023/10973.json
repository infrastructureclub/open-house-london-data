The building features T.B. Huxley-Jones' bronze \"Reclining figure\" sculpture and the \"Hornsey window\", an intricately etched glass map created by Hornsey School of Art lecturer Fred Mitchell.",

You’ll learn a little bit about the building and about Haringey Libraries, and will also get to explore a part of the library normally off limits to members of the public: our basement Reserve Stock section. We’ll explain how our stock is organised, then you’ll be shown some of the more unusual books we have and have time to browse the rooms and pick out something to borrow.",

No buggies to be taken into the basement, and visitors must be aware that there are areas with low lighting, tight shelving and dust, so the space is unfortunately not accessible to people with severe mobility or sight issues or severe asthma for this particular event. Tours will last approximately 1 hour and visitors will be free to explore the public areas of the library afterwards if they wish"
