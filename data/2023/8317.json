                "Van Gogh House is a non-profit contemporary arts organisation based in the South London boarding house where a young Vincent Van Gogh lived from 1873-74. More than a time capsule of Van Gogh’s year in Brixton, the house was established in 2019 as a site of creative production and hosts a dynamic programme of exhibitions, residencies and events that support contemporary artists to make a living in their lifetime.",
                "We exist to celebrate the remarkable legacy of 87 Hackford Road’s different occupants and champion research-led artistic practice that engages with the history of the house.",
                "As we support artists to make new links between Van Gogh’s time in London and their own practice, we also provide opportunities for our local community to learn and contribute to these conversations through workshops and educational events.",
                "When artists are not living and working in Van Gogh House, we are open to the public. We are open five days a week between September - December for our annual exhibition, and host monthly guided tours about the legacy of the house, and community events throughout the year. We also have a sister space, San Mei Gallery, a short walk away.",
                "Van Gogh House is a registered Community Interest Company."
