The architect was William Thompson, and the builder William Mountford Nurse. When it opened to the paying public, attractions ranged from demonstrations of the new art of photography to a ride underwater in the famous diving bell. The building was substantially extended in 1848 by the addition of a theatre for \"optical exhibitions\" including the \"hydro-electrical microscope, the physioscope and dissolving view\", on the south side of the building. The Polytechnic became the world leader in spectacular magic lantern shows."

Rooms were continually added and changed in a piecemeal way, but in 1910 the building closed for two years for major rebuilding. Most of the building was demolished (but not the blocks containing the theatre, swimming pool and gymnasium) and rebuilt, with nine levels replacing the existing four. The first architect was Frank Verity, who was replaced by George Mitchell. The classical façade, rebuilt to match the prevailing style in Regent Street, is unchanged."
