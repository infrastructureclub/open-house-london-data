The event focuses on the multilayered term ‘open’ with emphasis on the sensibility of ‘exposure’ being open spirited, reaching out, standing up, projecting our voices and offering support.\nBeck Road itself houses resident artists and artist studios to the north and south of the bridge’s mouth. It is a living breathing creative space, using the street as a communal stage for a theatre of artistry, through inclusivity, participation and collaboration. Reflecting its location in the heart of Hackney as a vibrant and culturally expansive borough in conjunction with Open House London to highlight the roads significant heritage, ‘OPEN’ stimulates natural voyeuristic curiosity to draw in and further widen communities. \n‘OPEN’ 2023 includes an array of workshops and creative out-reach projects, communicating through artistic expression to activate the notion of openness, in gesture and performance, through drawing, painting, portraiture, sculpture, photography and moving image, capturing individuality, beyond the frame of a thrown open window."
