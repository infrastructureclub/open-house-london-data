                "Selsdon's history spans almost 1,000 years, with many Royal Connections along the way (Henry VIII reputedly stayed here while he was courting Ann Boleyn when she was staying locally). The building itself has had many iterations and has been extensively remodelled over the years. From Anglo-Saxon hall, to medieval farmhouse, it was then remodelled to a Tudor and Elizabethan manor house and a notable Victorian country seat, and it has now been transformed into Birch (Selsdon). The interior designers have championed many of the original features,  while adding in our own Birch style,  bringing the building to life with colour, textures and a curated selection of greenery."
