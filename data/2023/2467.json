                "St Lawrence Whitchurch has a stone built tower that dates back to medieval times (c.1360). The church was rebuilt in a unique Continental Baroque style in 1715 by James Brydges, the first Duke of Chandos.\n \nThe walls and ceiling of the dramatic interior are covered with paintings by French and Italian artists. The panels on the ceiling show miracles taken mostly from St John’s Gospel. The ceiling above the altar depicts the Adoration of Jehovah. Behind the altar is an imitation sky lit by a concealed window which is characteristic of the baroque of continental Europe. The tradition and style suggests that the whole of the ceiling was painted by Louis Laguerre. The paintings of the Nativity and the Descent from the Cross, which are seen on either side of the altar, and the Transfiguration, which is above the Duke’s Pew, are attributed to Antonio Bellucci.",
                "Most of the interior woodwork is original and is attributed to Grinling Gibbons. This includes the organ case which is carved with cherubs, pea pods and other typical Grinling Gibbons decorations. The famous composer George Frideric Handel was employed by the Duke of Chandos around 1717-18 as composer in residence. Handel composed eleven Chandos Anthems for the Duke and these were almost certainly performed in the church.",
                "On the north side of the church is the Mausoleum built to the order of the Duke of Chandos. The centrepiece is a monument to the first Duke in anything but a humble style!"
