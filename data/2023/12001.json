Until the late 1990s the island’s largest employer was Percy Dalton’s Famous Peanut Company, at the Old Ford Works in Dace Road. Bridget Riley and Britannia Works are located in the former factory buildings, opposite each other on Dace Road.",
                "SPACE Place and a gallery on the ground floor of Britannia Works provided an artists’ resource from 2000 – 2005 and a base for Public Art, Training and Media Arts programmes. Launchpad training programme ran from Nov 2000 – March 2001, funded by the London Development Agency. It provided expert training and support to artists and arts professionals. The Media Arts programme provided technical skills in digital video production, web animation, photoshop etc. After moving to the Triangle in 2005, the Media Lab continued running courses until 2012."
