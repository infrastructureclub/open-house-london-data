                "Bank and Monument stations – a single operational unit today – were originally stations built by different companies.",
                "The District Railway opened ‘Eastcheap’ station in October 1884, although the station’s name was changed to ‘The Monument’ a month after opening.",
                "In 1898, the Waterloo & City Railway opened a station here known as ‘City’, as the line only ran between Waterloo station and the City of London.",
                "The City and South London Railway – a forerunner of the Northern line – opened a station at King William Street in 1890. In February 1900, they closed this station and opened a new Bank station a short distance away. Later that year, the Central London Railway also began calling here.",
                "In 1933, the Underground installed escalators to connect the\nDistrict and Circle lines at Monument with the Central and\nNorthern lines at Bank. In 1960, a similar connection was\nestablished when the moving walkways known as ‘travelators’\nwere installed between the Waterloo & City line – then\noperated by British Rail – and Bank station.",
                "In 1991, the expansion of the Docklands Light Railway to Bank\nmeant that the City of London was now connected with the\nemerging financial centre at Canary Wharf.",
                "In 2023, a major renovation project at Bank station was completed. This project expanded capacity at Bank station by 40%, adding two new ticket halls, 12 new escalators, two new lifts, and more than 1000 metres of new tunnels. The renovation also resulted in the restoration of some existing heritage items, such as the Hutton Panels that formerly stood at Bucklersbury House and the fire insurance markers that are at the new Cannon Street entrance."
