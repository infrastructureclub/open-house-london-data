                "The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) was founded in 1916, when Dame Sarah Swift approached MP Sir Arthur Stanley to support her in founding a College to help regulate the nursing profession and pursue educational goals. Swift was an early supporter of state registration for nurses and said that her wartime work had opened her eyes to the chaotic state of nurses’ training and the urgent need to protect the interests of nurses. Today, the RCN is both a professional organisation and a trade union, representing over half a million nursing staff, promoting excellence in practice and shaping health policies."

Cooper was later commissioned to integrate the two buildings with 21 Cavendish Square, and a new façade was created. The RCN as it appears from the street today was completed in 1934.",
                "Further interior renovations were carried out by EPA Architects in 2000-01 and Bisset Adams Architects in 2012-13. The former integrated the buildings internally, with the imaginative addition of a five-storey glass walkway at the rear of the College, while the latter refurbishment included the development of a modern Library and Heritage Centre."
