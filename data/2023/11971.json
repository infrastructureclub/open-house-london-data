One of the first refugee communities who settled here were the French Huguenots who fled religious persecution in the 17th century. Their story was one of danger, terror, courage, optimism, hope, and change. In this walk we’ll (re)discover the area, looking for traces of Huguenots’ heritage still visible today – where and how did they live and work? What happened to their places of worship and how did they make a living? We’ll find clues hidden in plain sight, pass commemorative plaques and learn why many of them kept canaries."
