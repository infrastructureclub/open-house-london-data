                "Leyton House is a new build house that has been designed to maximise the potential of its urban infill setting.  It is a contemporary design that respects the spirit of the adjacent 1960â€™s terrace whilst addressing the Victorian context of the neighbouring street and one that creates a harmonious urban fabric that positively contributes to the streetscape.",
                "The design is defined by its elemental nature and comprises two distinct blocks - a monolithic masonry plinth at street level and a finely detailed timber structure above. The brick references the local brickwork with the same materiality maintained throughout the courtyard gardens and ground floor living spaces, creating a series of internal and external rooms.  The hit and miss brickwork over the windows provides privacy whilst the building is completed by a sculptural chimney that is topped by a concrete crown, with the shape of the openings referencing nearby Victorian chimney pots.",
                "Despite the limited budget our aim was to create a generous home that achieves an unexpected sense of tranquillity and provides a retreat from the bustle of city life whilst adding an element of considered design to the streetscape that has been embraced by the local community."

Every project is bespoke; developed and tested through a rigorous process of hand sketching, model making and detailed technical drawing.",
