                "The captivating history of Fulham Palace spans over 1,300 years and 133 Bishops of London.",
                "The site has been a residence of the Bishops of London since AD 704, when Bishop Waldhere acquired the Manor of Fulham — a vast estate covering most of Hammersmith, Fulham, Acton, Ealing and Finchley. As bishops were called ‘Princes of the Church’ the estate became known as Fulham Palace.",
                "During the mid-13th century the original manor house was abandoned. The foundations of the current house start at this time. Over the past 750 years the house has evolved as different Bishops carried out building works, from remodelling the great hall to demolishing the Tudor state wing.  This has created an interesting mixture of architectural styles which reflect changing fashions and the differing needs of the Bishops and their families.",
                "Fulham Palace has always been a place of refuge. The Bishops of London used the Palace primarily as a summer retreat away from the crowded and dirty city. It was also a place to entertain important visitors, including royalty. Queen Elizabeth I was guest of honour at a lavish banquet in 1601. Over 150 years later King George III was treated to a simpler affair — breakfast.",
                "After the English Reformation in the 16th century clergy were allowed to marry and Fulham Palace became a family home. In the 19th century the Bishops and their wives began to share the house and garden more with the community, hosting large parties and church pageants.",
                "During the World Wars, Fulham Palace was a refuge for more than the Bishops and their families. In 1918 a hospital for wounded soldiers occupied much of the house. During the Blitz in 1940 two hundred people stayed for several nights after their homes were destroyed by bombs.",
                "Bishop Stopford was the final Bishop of London to live here, leaving in 1973. The London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham ran the site until April 2011, when the independent charity Fulham Palace Trust was formed and took over the management of the estate.  Now Fulham Palace is being restored to its former glory.",
                "The house is a mixture of different architectural styles. Each reveals the changing tastes and needs of the Bishops and their families.",
                "The red brick Tudor courtyard and the great hall are the oldest parts of the surviving building, dating to around 1495.  Over the centuries, the great hall was remodelled to suit the fashions of the day. Its function changed too; originally a banqueting hall and court room, it became a drawing room, chapel and finally a dining room.",
                "In the 1760s Bishop Terrick demolished the medieval chapel and redesigned parts of the house and a chapel in the fashionable Strawberry Hill Gothic style. The design improved the views from the house of the River Thames and the newly landscaped garden.",
                "This Gothic Revival was short lived, though a few pointed windows do remain. Around 50 years later Bishop Howley had the facades remodelled to their current Georgian style and the chapel turned into a library. He was not a fan what he called ‘Gothic nonsense’.",
                "The most recent addition to the house is the chapel, built for Bishop Tait in the 1860s. The elaborate brick and mosaic work quickly fell out of fashion, however, and just 30 years later Bishop Creighton and his wife covered one of the walls with a curtain, and added their own altarpiece. Fulham Palace Trust’s future restoration plans include revealing a portion of the original design."

The rest of the courtyard was added c.1500-20, including the tower which is comparable to that at the Old Palace, Hatfield. The porch was remodelled for Bishop Howley c.1815. The south façade was refaced in 1853 as indicated by the dated badge of Bishop Blomfield. The fountain is by William Butterfield (1886), as is the Coachman’s Lodge (1893) at the entrance.  The wooden gates to the courtyard have been dated by dendrochronology to 1493-5. The brickwork on the west façade was restored in 2018-19."

                "Gothick additions for Bishop Terrick: Stiff Leadbetter provided three new facades in the fashionable Strawberry Hill style in the 1760s, including a new chapel. The windows of the north façade remain, as well as three altered rooms on the south.   Samuel Pepys Cockerell adapted the Palace from 1814-18 for Bishop Howley, removing the crenellations, adding an extra floor and remodelling the east front."
