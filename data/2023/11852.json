                "First established by Henry VIII, the Royal Arsenal has a long and distinguished history that climaxed during WWI when it employed approximately 80,000 people. The surrounding area's rise and fall mirrored that of the Arsenal itself, which finally closed completely in the 1994. For years, Arsenal was off-limits to public, but recent developments and investments including the opening of the Woolwich station of Elizabeth line have made it desirable again to live, work, and play.",
                "Today the Royal Arsenal serves as an anchor for the renewal and revitalisation of Woolwich. Many original buildings built over the centuries have been re-purposed as restaurants, bars, performing arts venues as well as a huge new residential complex that mixes the old and new.  This tour looks at what the Royal Arsenal has become and reveals hints of its vast history as well as contemplates its future and that of  Woolwich."
