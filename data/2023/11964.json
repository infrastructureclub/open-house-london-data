This is a rare example of a royal initiative in public housing, and is an interesting precursor to the current King’s architectural initiatives. We will also look at the way the area as a whole has evolved over time, and the relationship between the Duchy as a landowner and local government as its role expanded and changed from the middle of the 19th century."
