The renovations involved changing the use of every space, moving the living accommodation to the rear connecting the spaces to the garden and relocating the bedrooms to the front of the house. The brief included the use of smart home technology through the renovations: lighting, watering, smoke detection, appliances and AV. Storage was important to consider with the use of every available space. The flat design also allowed some flexibility to allow the family to grow."
