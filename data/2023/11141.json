                "OVERVIEW:\nWe're incredibly excited to be hosting multi-sensory installation 'Lay Me Down in Praise' by Justen LeRoy, at our gallery, event space and working studio, The Art House. As part of Open House Festival 2023, we're opening our doors to the public so they can experience the installation for themselves, and explore the space we call home.",
                "ABOUT THE INSTALLATION:\nLay Me Down in Praise, created by multidisciplinary artist Justen LeRoy, is a three-channel film installation that asks how the scream, moan, and melisma—also known as the vocal run— provide a sonic route toward Black environmentalism. LeRoy layers clips of Black performers with images of geological activity. Through this juxtaposition, the artist considers how resistance and regeneration inhabit the wordless screeches of the Earth and the history of Black sound. Lay Me Down in Praise insists the Earth's aches and upheavals, felt in volcanic eruptions, tectonic shifts, and other cataclysmic events, are entangled with Black resistance and liberation.",
                "The installation is facilitated by re:arc Institute, a Copenhagen-based organisation working at the intersection of architecture and climate action.",
                "ABOUT ACRYLICIZE AND THE ART HOUSE:\nThe Art House is the home of Acrylicize, an award-winning global creative studio. We tell our client’s stories through bespoke artworks, installations, art curation and activations, playing in the space between brand expression and fine art. We exist as a dynamic, art-driven eco-system assuming the role of creator, curator, and activator at different points through the projects we deliver.",
                "Our vision for The Art House transcends the services we offer, and becomes a living, breathing manifestation of our reason for being. A space where art gets conceived, made, exhibited, and celebrated."
