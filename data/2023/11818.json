Importantly, we’re aiming to partner with local education organisations to support a programme of free access to these spaces.\n3) Design workspaces on the first and second floors that reflect a variety of professional stages. So if you’re a hybrid worker, solopreneur, or startup, you’ll have access to a wonderful space that reflects your working rhythm.",
