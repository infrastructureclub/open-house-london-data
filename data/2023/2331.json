                "In the early 19th century, the growth of towns and cities due to the Industrial Revolution meant that traditional places of burial, such as church-yards and dissenters' burial grounds, could not cope. In London, the first of the large commercial, inter-denominational cemeteries, the General Cemetery of All Souls at Kensal Green, was opened in 1833. This was followed by the South Metropolitan Cemetery at what was then called Lower Norwood, opened in 1837. It was designed by Sir William Tite, in a Gothic style.",
                "The cemetery was laid out by Tite in an informal manner, with curving roadways and deciduous trees, following English landscaping tradition. He designed the Episcopal (Anglican) and Dissenters' (nonconformist) Chapels, the lodge, the gates, and the high walls and railings. Both chapels had catacombs beneath, which together could accommodate some 3,500 coffins. The cemetery was consecrated by the Bishop of Winchester on 7 December 1837, except for an area around the Dissenters' Chapel which was allocated for nonconformists. Provision was made not only for privately-purchased family graves and vaults, but also for paupers' burials in common graves.",
                "The first burial took place five days after the consecration. It was of Harriet Raincock, sister of a stockbroker who had bought a family plot for £3 3s. Sadly, the tombstone with its inscriptions of many members of her family, including her sister Sophia, an artist, who died in 1890, no longer survives. The numbers of burials each year rose gradually, and the South Metropolitan soon became the most fashionable cemetery in south London – known as the 'Millionaires' Cemetery' from the quality of its mausolea and other elaborate monuments. In 1842 a small enclave was purchased by London's Greek community. This was subsequently enlarged by further purchases, and a chapel was built some time after 1872. This Greek section now contains an outstanding collection of superb monuments (18 are listed).",
                "By the early 20th century, the cemetery was becoming largely filled with graves, and even some of the original roadways were used for burials. In 1915 a crematorium and columbarium were installed beside the Dissenters' Chapel.  During World War II a number of monuments were destroyed or damaged; flying bombs in 1944 badly damaged the Dissenters' Chapel, and destroyed the cemetery lodge (which had only just been rebuilt in the 1930s). The Dissenters' Chapel was demolished in 1955, and replaced by the present chapel incorporating the crematorium, to serve all denominations. The Episcopal Chapel was demolished in 1960 and replaced by a rose garden. The catacombs, however, still survive: those beneath the crematorium house the furnaces, but those beneath the rose garden remain complete with coffins and unique hydraulic coffin lift, and are now listed Grade II, although not considered safe for public access.",
                "In 1965 the cemetery was compulsorily purchased for £6,000 by Lambeth Council, using Public Health Act powers. A condition of the deed of transfer was that the rights of existing grave owners were to be maintained, and the Act of Parliament establishing the cemetery and governing its operations was never repealed. The importance of the cemetery and the quality of its monuments were emphasised in 1978 when it was included within a conservation area, and in 1981 when the entrance arch, gates, walls and railings and 44 monuments were listed (seven Grade II*, the rest Grade II – a further 21 monuments have since been listed).",
                "Despite this apparent protection in law, the cemetery was subjected over a couple of decades by Lambeth Council to a programme of 'lawn conversion'. During this period, over 10,000 monuments were removed, ignoring rights of grave owners and keeping no proper records of the position of graves. Moreover, nearly 1,000 private graves were re-sold for new burials. The destruction was eventually stopped in 1991 (by which time two listed monuments had disappeared and several others had been badly damaged), by the Diocese of Southwark exerting their jurisdiction over the cemetery, 80 per cent of which is consecrated ground. Their Consistory Court in 1994 judged the 'lawn conversion' and re-sale of private graves to have been illegal. The power of management of the cemetery was delegated to a Scheme of Management Committee composed of representatives from both the Diocese and Lambeth Council. As ordered in the judgement, the Council have restored/repaired many of the disappeared/damaged listed monuments, and a landscape management survey has been carried out.",
                "In the past few years, a concerted effort by Lambeth Council, Historic England and the Friends of West Norwood Cemetery has resulted in the restoration/repair of numerous monuments, as well as parts of the walls and railings. Preparatory work has started for the restoration of the catacombs. The roadway and drainage systems of parts of the cemetery have also been refurbished, and a new memorial garden has been constructed in the north-east corner of the cemetery. After much hard work by Lambeth and the Friends on the bid, an award of £4.6m was awarded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund for a 5 year project, now in its 4th year."
