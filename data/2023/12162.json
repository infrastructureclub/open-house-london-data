This manifesto evolved from the detailed consultation conversations between Hayhurst & Co, the school community and the local authority that established the project’s key objectives and a vision for the identity of the educational environment. The manifesto covered subjects such as ‘pedagogy’, ‘nature’, ‘community’ and ‘well-being’: defining and expressing of the school’s ethos and community outlook."

This provides parents with access to its various facilities, whilst also accommodating pick-up and drop-off of multiple siblings simultaneously.\nThe new school is conceived as part of the surrounding parkland landscape and its building and boundary are designed to extend the park, both physically and perceptively. \nThe white, filigree site enclosure and building envelope provide a multi-layered backdrop to the public spaces they face. Planting is strategically placed to grow up and through the façade, creating pieces of vertical park, whilst carefully considered openings through the bespoke perforate fencing allow visual permeability without compromise to the \nschool’s sense of protection."

The external spaces include a country garden, a potting shed and fallen logs for informal play."

The main route between the entrance and \nthe hall was widened to become a ‘gallery’ for large-scale hanging artwork and parents to mingle in the heart of the building.\nClassroom storage walls are punctured to create a ‘shopfront window’ for each class to present their work, and windows and rooflights mediate long and short views to make teaching spaces feel part of the extended landscape and wider city."
