History becomes an integral part of it from the very inception of its design, enriched through construction, and expands even after the building’s completion. As architectural landscapes are repurposed for contemporary needs, they continue to respond to challenges and stigmas of marginalised communities. \r\n\r\nJoin us on Saturday 9th September (11am-1pm) to discuss what happens when people inhabit landscapes and new communities emerge. \r\n\r\nAs landscapes mature, we are given a choice: to ignore or embrace what came before.\r\n\r\nWhat happens when the histories of these communities are neglected?",

The project brings together 15 young people who will work and learn as festival curators, deciding on themes and areas of London they are interested in and want to celebrate. The Open House Festival 2023 is a two-week celebration of London’s homes, architecture and neighbourhoods. For 30 years, we have opened-up London’s best known buildings, as well as some of its best kept secrets, to a wider audience. The festival is a chance to share and champion what’s special to us for others to explore and learn from."
