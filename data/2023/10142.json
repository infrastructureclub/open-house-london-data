                "Boston Manor House is a Jacobean Manor House, built in 1622-3. There was a Tudor mansion on site previously, but it was cleared to build the current house. \nThe House has large park grounds (28-30 acres) which have recently completed development through a separate National Lottery Heritage Funded project.\n \nQueen Elizabeth I granted Boston Manor to Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester who immediately sold it to Sir Thomas Gresham, an internationally wealthy merchant and financier who had also bought Osterley as his summer residence. He later founded the Royal Exchange.\n \nAs Gresham died without children, the property went to his stepson (Sir William Reade) who lived in Osterley so had to obtain a Patent of Possession in 1610 from James I so that he could inherit. He married Mary Goldsmith who built Boston Manor House in 1622–3, immediately after Sir William Reade's death.\nShe then married Sir Edward Spencer of Althorp, who gained ownership and appears to have bought out the claim of the late William Reade's heirs so that, upon her death in 1658, the lands passed to Lady Mary's heir, John Goldsmith.\nIn 1670, his executors sold Boston Manor House to another very wealthy city merchant: James Clitherow I and the Clitherow family owned Boston Manor from 1670-1922",
                "John Bourchier Stracey-Clitherow was the last private owner of Boston Manor. The House and the surrounding 20 acres was purchased by the Brentford Urban District Council and opened as a public park in 1924.",
                "The House reopened to the public in July 2023 after a five-year restoration programme, which has seen it completely refurbished with support from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and a range of other funders.",
                "The House has not been restored to look as it did in one particular period of its history.  Instead, wherever there was the strongest surviving evidence of a decorative style in a room, the room was restored to that period.  This means Boston Manor House has rooms in 17th, 18th and 19th Century styles."
