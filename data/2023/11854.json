                "Co-curated with Arup Phase 2, 0º00 Navigation is a body of work by British artist Simon Faithfull, which relates to two epic journeys he undertook in order to trace 0° line of longitude across the planet. It seeks to explore the paradoxes and absurdities of this hypothetical line. This installation consists of 38 paving stones that are engraved with drawings made by the artist as he travelled south along the Greenwich Meridian across Europe and Africa. Depicting the landscapes and buildings along the route, from the English Channel to Accra in Ghana, the stones are installed in a straight line, due south to echo Faithfull’s journey, following the invisible north / south line. The Greenwich Meridian runs parallel to this installation.",

                "Simon Faithfull was born in 1966 in Braziers Park – a utopian commune in Ipsden, Oxfordshire. He studied at Central St Martins (1985-89) and the University of Reading (1994-96). His work has been described as an attempt to understand and explore the planet as a sculptural object – to test its limits and report back from its extremities. His practice takes a variety of forms – ranging from video, to digital drawing, installation work and writing. Faithfull has exhibited widely in the UK and abroad and his work is held in a number of public collections including Centre Pompidou, Paris and the Government Art Collection and Arts Council Collection, UK. Faithfull is a Professor at Slade School of Fine Art, London. He lives and works in Berlin."

Taking the House Mill, Bromley-by-Bow, as its starting container, The Lay Shaft Drive is Down considers mills in relation to water, to industry, to food, to hardship and nurture: the tie to the colonial relationships that bind both people and production through contentious, often violent, yet sometimes radical histories.",

                "Helen Cammock was born in Staffordshire, UK in 1970. She studied at the University of Brighton and the Royal College of Art, London, and currently lives between London and Wales. Helen Cammock works across film, photography, print, text, and performance. She produces works stemming from a deeply involved research process that explore the complexities of social histories. Central to her practice is the voice: the uncovering of marginalised voices within history, the question of who speaks on behalf of whom and on what terms, as well as how her own voice reflects in different ways on the stories explored in her work. Cammock was a joint winner of the Turner Prize in 2019, nominated for her solo exhibition The Long Note at Void Gallery, Derry (2018) which was subsequently exhibited at Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin (2019).",
                "Tributaries explores artistic responses to our relationships with bodies of water. Situated in The House Mill, the exhibition brings together five artist films that critically engage with water through global histories and geographies of trade, colonial legacies and the climate crisis. As the world’s largest surviving tidal mill and a building that is increasingly impacted by flooding, the House Mill’s context – past and present – is foregrounded in this exhibition. The films, like tributaries, flow into an important conversation about the ways we live with water. Contributing artists: Martha Atienza, Ursula Biemann, Hanna Ljungh, Daniela Medina Poch and Elizabeth Gallón Droste, and Alberta Whittle."
