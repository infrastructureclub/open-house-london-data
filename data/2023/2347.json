                "Among Franklin's many and varied inventions were improved bifocal glasses, a 24-hour clock for navigation, watertight bulkheads for ships, equipment to measure sea water temperatures at different depths, and the discovery of the positive and negative charge of electricity. Among the many scientific papers and pamphlets he wrote at  Craven Street was \"Plain instructions for the inoculation in the Small-Pox\".",
                "Though built as a lodging house (Franklin was the tenant of Margaret Stevenson, though was said to be less a lodger than head of household during his long tenure), in the 20th century the building was used as a hotel and as a base for several non-profit groups. By the end of the century, when the Friends of Benjamin Franklin House were granted the freehold to 36 Craven Street from the British Government, the property was in dire condition. The management team and numerous organisations and volunteers have worked tirelessly to realise a dynamic museum and educational facility that highlights the timeless relevance of Benjamin Franklin and the tumultuous times in which he lived.",
                "By October 1998, essential structural repairs were completed. The work included the installation of a steel support beam, tuckpointing of stress-cracked brick corners, and steel channels installed vertically and diagonally for stabilisation. The period panelling was preserved and reinstated. Support included grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund and English Heritage."
