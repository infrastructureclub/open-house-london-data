                "Although Tottenham has medieval origins, its built heritage dates principally from the late 18C onwards. Once a genteel Georgian suburb, Tottenham rapidly evolved into a bustling urban centre following the arrival of the railway in 1872 and subsequent large-scale residential, commercial and civic development.",
                "The length of Tottenham High Road is notable as an example of an essentially late-Victorian and Edwardian commercial townscape. The early-Victorian shopping parade of Warner Terrace (479-491 High Road) was later joined by an increasingly eclectic range of architectural styles throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.",
                "Most of the buildings that helped to create the high street survive but much of its historic character has been\nlost in the 20C. The projects that form part of the Tottenham HS HAZ aim to rediscover and reinstate some of that lost character."
