We stop at the Treasury to hear about a huge debt; the largest ever in British history that had to be paid to end slavery (but where did it end up?), we hear about the Royal who was elbow deep in blood, the savagery of a man called “Lord Vulture” and how did he meet his end? The bigoted and unpleasant views of a famous war time leader and we stop at one statue to hear about the explorer who had a very dark secret and to finish we end with a stunning statue dedicated to a man who dared to defy colonialism."
