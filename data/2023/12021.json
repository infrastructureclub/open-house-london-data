                "In Production is a shared professional studio space launched by Turning Earth in 2017 as part of its mission to promote ceramics talent within London.  Located within a former light industrial workspace, the studio is designed for a mix of users: makers launching a professional career and wanting to learn studio skills in a safe environment before striking out on their own; professional artists who want an affordable long term work place; and advanced hobbyists who want to stretch their making beyond what can be accommodated within Turning Earth's membership studios.  In Production is very proud of its track record in helping to launch the careers of some of the UK's most exciting designer makers."
