                "Situated next to St Mary’s church, 25 The Embankment lies at the heart of historic Twickenham. First indicated on Moses Glover’s 1635 survey of the Isleworth Hundred, the idiosyncratic footprint of the building and exposed internal brickwork date the building to this time. \nThe Georgian symmetry of its present appearance is disturbed by an 18th century side extension over a former passageway, with the whole faced with nineteenth century London stock. \nBelieved to have once been owned by the Twining tea family, it was home to a branch of the local Hammerton watermen, ferrymen and boatbuilder family who lived here from 1896 until 1939 or later. The last private owner was local conservation campaigner Jack Ellis who left the property to become a museum for the old borough of Twickenham when he died in 1994 .",
