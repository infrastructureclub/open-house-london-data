The project restored the ancient system of streams, ditches, flood channels and reedbeds running alongside the Thames – many of which date back to the Tudor period and the founding of Hampton Court Palace.",
                "Within the Paddocks are extensive depressions and water collection areas that once formed valuable wetland habitats and collectively must be one of oldest remaining floodplain drainage systems left in London. Thought to have been managed historically as terraces or flood meadow for stock grazing.",
