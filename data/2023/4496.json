                "The Royal Astronomical Society moved into Burlington House in 1874. Before then, it occupied rooms in Lincoln’s Inn and Somerset House. The Society’s apartments were specially built by the government for the learned societies which were required to vacate Somerset House, and the RAS now shares the courtyard of Burlington House with the premises of five other learned societies: the Linnean Society of London, the Society of Antiquaries, the Royal Society of Chemistry and the Geological Society of London together with the Royal Academy of Arts. Glass panels in the doorways were glazed with etched panes showing the logos of the various Societies. The ‘AS’ monogram can be seen in the front doors, and is repeated in plasterwork in the staircase, and in the cast iron radiator panels in the main hallway and in the main library on the first floor. Leading on from the inner lobby is the building’s entrance hall, with a splendid staircase and a lift, with glass panels revealing striking astronomical images. At the foot of the main staircase is a bust of founding member Francis Baily (by a sculptor called Baley!), presented by Baily’s sister after he died in 1837. On the first floor landing is a window designed and produced by Sally Scott, in association with Nero Designs, made from 10mm thick white glass using acid, sandblast and colour. This window is an abstract interpretation of astronomy and geophysics. It shows a cosmic spiral, containing the motto of the Royal Astronomical Society, quicquid nitet notandum (whatever shines should be observed). Within the spiral are numbers of astronomical importance: 2.73 (the temperature of the cosmic microwave background) and 223 (the number of lunar synodic months in a Saros cycle of eclipses). The 5 Platonic Solids are timeless symbols of the elements and the relationship of mathematics to the Universe. The elliptical orbits represent the journey of the Pioneer space probes, the first spacecraft to travel on interstellar trajectories. The first floor landing leads to the Society’s Library."
