The sculpture is a contemporary interpretation of a Mandala Rangoli. Mandalas are graphic representations of the cosmos; Rangoli are bright, coloured patterns, traditionally painted in the entrance of homes to welcome the Hindu goddess Lakshmi and luck, positivity and happiness to the household. These ideas are fused in Mirrored Cosmos, by creating a colourful mandala to represent the beauty of the perplexing Universe we inhabit. The mirrored surfaces reflect ourselves - small, confounding, intricate individuals, connected by existence - tiny cosmoses, within a larger one."
