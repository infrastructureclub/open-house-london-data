The House, as it is referred to was completed in 1774 and the Society (after 1908 'Royal') has been in residence, ever since. The House boasts several original Adams features, including the cornice in the Great Room, Adam stairwells and 14 Adam fireplaces. The Great Room showcases James Barry’s series of paintings started in 1777 and completed in 1801, alongside portraits painted by Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds.",
