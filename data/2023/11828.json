Since then, it has been home to the Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity, patient and family accommodation, and the hospital creche. In 2021 the building re-opened as the Sight and Sound Centre at GOSH, the UK’s first dedicated facility for children and young people with sight and hearing loss."
