It offers courses ranging from art and design Foundation, through to BA (Hons) undergraduate degrees and MA postgraduate courses in fine art, carving, conservation, and art histories. In addition, it offers the only undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in Britain in stone and wood carving:  architectural stone and ornamental woodcarving & gilding.",

Arts education therefore should not be a privilege, but something that anyone can access and use to empower themselves and those around them."
