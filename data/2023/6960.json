The necessary local administration offices were accommodated in the curved part of the D with the prestigious Council Chamber, Committee Rooms and Mayor's Parlour across the diameter, adjoining each other, with an adjustable sinking wall for larger or smaller areas as needed. The Magistrates Courts were on the floor below.",
                "The Guildhall was built by Gee, Walker and Slater Ltd of London and Derby. The authorities decided to use local, British and Empire sourced material. The bricks came from the Oxshott Brickworks, the tiles from the Swallow Brick and Tile Works, Cranleigh and stone detailing from Portland which was carved with emblems representing the River."

Despite protest from the public, council, magistrates and the press, the Magistrates Courts closed in 2011 and the fate of the space was unknown.",
                "It was later decided that the accommodation would become the new home of Registration Services and the Archive and Local History service. Due to the special character of the courts, the conversion of the space was to be accomplished through a careful restoration project guided by Historic England. Kingston History Centre opened in October 2015."
