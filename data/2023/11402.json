                "City Mill Skate is a research project that has used a shared design process to realise a proposal for the construction of semi-permanent skateable objects within the new University College London campus (known as UCL East) on Pool Street, E20. City Mill Pool Street opened to the public on October 2022 and is now host to a lively programme of skate lessons, skate Jam events and more! Join us for a special lecture presentation and Q&A at the cinema space within the One Pool Street UCL Building, followed by a walking tour of the City Mill Pool Street skateable space. \nPlease note, due to UCL building access regulations, the event on Sunday 10th Sept will be a walking tour of the City Mill Pool Street site only (and no presentation at the One Pool Street UCL Building)."
