This allows us to test how people of various capabilities react to different environmental stimuli (including lighting, sound and smell) so that we can then design places which are better for everyone. So far, we have simulated environments ranging from an urban park to a supermarket, and have helped to design more accessible buses, trains, stations and streets in the UK and around the world. You will get the chance to experience some of the state-of-the-art lighting and sound facilities we have to offer, and get an insight into how we can use this to make the world a better place."

This is a great opportunity to witness how both the building and our research are helping to shape a better future."

                "PEARL is a massive space in which we can manipulate the ground, simulate different lighting conditions, create soundscapes and concoct smells. Learning about how we respond to such conditions then allows us to design the world in a way which is healthier and more sustainable for all. The PEARL building stands on part of the site of the old May and Baker pharmaceutical factory. The building comprises a portal frame, cladded in steel, with a distinctive Corten steel façade. Within it is housed our main experimental Space: a very large space that is 100m long, up to 40m wide, and column-free in order to give the flexibility our experiments require. There are many interesting architectural details which you will notice once inside that help to create the blank canvas needed in order to re-create different types of environments. Furthermore, the building is powered by 4,000 square metres of solar panels which produces much more clean energy than we could use. We are proud to donate this energy to the surrounding community and be recognised as UCL's first net zero carbon building."
