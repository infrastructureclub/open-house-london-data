                "Burton was a remarkable traveller and explorer, linguist, poet, soldier, diplomat, author and translator of major works in Arabic and other languages including: The Kama Sutra, 1001 Arabian Nights and The Perfumed Garden. After an early career serving in the Army in India (1842-1853) and later fighting in the Crimean War (1855-1856), he travelled to Mecca as well as to Africa and the Americas under the auspices of the Royal Geographical Society. Between 1856-1860, he journeyed to the great lakes of central Africa in search of the source of the river Nile. Co-founder of the Anthropological Society of London in 1863 and Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, he was appointed a KCMG (Knights Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George) in 1886."
