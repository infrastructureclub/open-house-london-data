The house is a Victorian terraced house that originally was badly built. It has four stories and built with two entrances: lower ground and upper ground.",
                "The basement is both an office space and an apartment and the top floor opened up to the loft to turn it into a double height space. That way the rooms can be used in different ways. The space is sometimes used by one person and sometimes by three: spaces can be organised around the number of users."
