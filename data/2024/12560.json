                "Its first public open days since 2022, 13 Princelet Street is typical of the speculative housing that sprang up in Spitalfields in the 18th century. In 1984, it was bought by Peter Lerwill who offered the building to the Landmark Trust as a bequest. The house was a wreck when it was found. Together with architect Julian Harrap, a careful three-year restoration programme followed: Roof and ceilings were replaced, new wiring, central heating and windows. \nThe work was done as conservatively as possible; the joinery in particular retains its patina. \nSince its restoration, many people enjoying a short break now share the experience of this extraordinary part of London."
