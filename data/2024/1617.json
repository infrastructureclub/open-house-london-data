                "The landmark Art Deco building, which is one of the few buildings in London to boast original 1930s features, was the University’s first permanent home after a century of being housed in a series of temporary premises. King George V laid the foundation stone on 26 June 1933 and the building welcomed its first occupants in 1936.",
                "Senate House, consisting of 19 floors and standing 210 feet (64m) high, was the tallest secular building in Britain on completion. It was constructed of the finest materials then available, including Portland stone, Travertine marble, English walnut and South American cypress. Acknowledged as a building of great architectural significance, it was listed as Grade II* in 1969.",
                "During the Second World War, Senate House was home to the Ministry of Information and inspired George Orwell’s description of the Ministry of Truth in his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. Besides being an architectural gem and a literary landmark, Senate House is also subject to urban mystification – allegedly Hitler planned to install the headquarters of Nazi dominion in Britain in the building on Malet Street."

It forms a new artist-led global coalition in response to the climate emergency and biodiversity loss, presented through a website featuring the range of newly commissioned art works. While in Senate House Library, you can visit A Thousand Words for Weather, the sound installation specially commissioned for the project."
