                "Working against the grain and thinking outside the conventional steel and stud wall box, architecture practice Cairn has pioneered use of a new low-carbon concrete in a house renovation and extension in Hackney, east London. Commissioned by an environmentally conscious client, the compact Victorian house renovation has been a testbed for LC3, a new kind of concrete which has the capacity to reduce total global CO2 emissions by 1-2% if adopted universally by the construction industry. The project demonstrates how a Victorian house can be renovated and extended with a substantially reduced environmental impact – 40% lower than a typical build deploying conventional concrete, steel frame box and plasterboard.",
                "Located on a densely-inhabited, car-free street, the two-storey terraced 77m² house occupies a constrained site with no back garden and only a thin strip of external space. As found, it was dark and cramped. The challenge was to work with what was there, designing as sustainably as possible through reuse and repurposing of existing materials to bring it up to modern day standards, creating a homely and productive new kitchen for its owner, a chef with a background in sustainable agriculture.",
                "Client and architect were committed to repurposing and, where new materials were necessary, bio-based materials - hempcrete, cork, woodfibre, woodwool, and lime plaster – were specified, to improve health and wellbeing benefits.",
                "The client and her partner have also actively participated in the project, working alongside the contractor and architect to cast by hand the hempcrete walls (timber framed with exposed hempcrete infill). The decision to make the walls by hand, replacing power tools with human energy, resulted in a rewarding collective activity and a project made by many hands.",
                "The approach to the base-build of the home is complemented by the furnishing and fittings within. These are re-used and given a second life wherever possible, such as the timber floor which has been reclaimed from Bow Magistrates Court and a collection of secondhand furniture and light fittings. The client was determined not to use new items, unless unavoidable, so that the house is imbued with character and unique histories."
