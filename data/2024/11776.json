                "Petts Wood owes its existence largely to one man – Basil Scruby. It was his vision, foresight and energy that, in the 1920s and 1930s, transformed a swathe of indifferent farmland in Kent into a desirable residential garden suburb, endowed with generous space and a style and layout clearly inspired by the example of Henrietta and Samuel Barnett’s Hampstead Garden Suburb.\nThis illustrated talk by Patrick Hellicar explores these and other questions, as well as drawing an intriguing portrait of Scruby, focusing on his life, his passions and influences, his personal and business ups and downs and his other many ventures."
