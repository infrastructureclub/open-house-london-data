This new pavilion provides a grand sense of arrival to the Hall which was missing from the previous entrance. The new glazed roof offers exciting new views of existing features, such as the distinctive cantilevered upper levels and ceremonial staircase. On floors 1-4, the floorplates have been extended, expanding the commercial letting space by 50%. Services have been replaced throughout, achieving a BREEAM “Exellent” rating."

The Main Hall is fully lined in fluted ash panelling and the Court Room lined with Coral Rosewood. There are nods within both the interior and exterior design to the Salters’ historical links with the salt trade: patterns, forms and textures evoke crystalline salt rocks.",

Surrounded by rich archaeology, the Salters’ garden enjoys views over the remains of the Roman London Wall and St Alphage Church."

The first medieval Hall, bequeathed in 1455, was situated in Bread Street but was later destroyed by fire. The Salters’ later Halls were also destroyed by fires in 1598 and 1666, and during bombing raids in 1941.",

                "The movement in Brutalism flourished between the 1950s and the 1960s. Its buildings are often characterised by the use of raw unfinished materials, bold geometries and the expression of function. Concrete proved an inexpensive material during the re-building of much of Britain after 1945. The term ‘Brutalist’ is derived from the French term “Beton Brut” meaning exposed concrete."
