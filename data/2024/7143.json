                "Growing fruit and vegetables had been the priority at The Oval in the decade running up to 1845. Not that the game was unknown in the area. The county of Surrey was acknowledged as one of the cradles of the game, and for a number of years matches had been a regular sight on both Kennington Common – where hangings were often staged too – and Walworth Common.",
                "The county club’s predecessor, the Montpelier Club, proved an able midwife. Having lost their ground in Walworth for building – a familiar refrain in more modern times – the club members approached the Otter family, who had taken out a lease on The Oval from the Duchy of Cornwall, owners of the land then and still to this day. That explains why all Surrey players bear the crest of the Prince of Wales, otherwise known as the Duke of Cornwall.",
                "Ambitious plans for the site back a decade earlier had not come to fruition and in 1845 it hosted only a moderately successful market garden, so the Montpelier approach proved welcome. A remarkable transition was effected between the signing of the lease in March 1845 and the start of cricket in May as contractor M Turtle – handily located nearby – transported 10,000 turfs from Tooting Common for a fee of £300."

As a condition of the new lease agreed in 1897, architects Muirhead & Baldwin completed the development in a remarkable six months, in time for the 1898 season. The final bill, though, was double the committee’s original budget of £14,000."
