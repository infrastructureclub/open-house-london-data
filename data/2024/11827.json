It was transformed into its current incarnation in 2020 when a group of locals successfully bid for a Community Assembly Grant to re-invigorate the garden and by so doing give it a new lease of life by creating an inclusive beautiful outdoor space in which people can feel safe, explore and discover nature and encourage people to mix outside their immediate friendship circles.",
                "The emphasis has been to create an edible garden with fruit trees, berry bushes, herbs, vegetables and some herbaceous flowers. It also aims to be a social focal point where people can arrange to meet friends, run workshops or simply pop in for a moment of peace."

The £20,000 of capital funding made a massive difference and enabled the space to be completely overhauled, a contaminated soil test to be commissioned, large raised beds to be constructed, soil, plants, pergola and a green-house purchased.",
                "It has run regular free workshops on everything from how to start a garden & green energy; to composting and flower arranging. With an increased number of volunteers, it now aims to keep the garden doors open seven days a week. Between 9.30 and 5.30.",
                "The project to rejuvenate Manor Park Community Garden is one big step towards making Manor Park greener with the hope that it will have a ripple effect on the area as a whole.",
