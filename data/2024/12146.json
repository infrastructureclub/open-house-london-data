                "From 1972 to 1990, the Soho Poly was one of London’s leading alternative theatre venues. Founded by the Soho Theatre Company and the Polytechnic of Central London (now University of Westminster), who owned the basement in which it was located, it was dedicated to widening access to the arts, frequently giving voice to underrepresented playwrights and actors. Adrian Shergold, Timberlake Wertenbaker, Caryl Churchill, Hanif Kureshi, Jamal Ali, John Hurt, Simon Callow, Nigel Hawthorne and Bob Hoskins were just some of the practitioners whose careers were nurtured at the Soho Poly. Recently restored after lying vacant for over 30 years, and under new artistic management, the Soho Poly is now an inclusive community hub for creativity, culture and wellbeing. It offers community engagement and diverse programming and provides a contemporary performance and education venue for the London arts community."
