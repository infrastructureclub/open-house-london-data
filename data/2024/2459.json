It was part of John Nash's development of Regents Street, & benefitted from the newly set up Church Building Commission in 1818. In the mid 1970's All Souls went through a major refurbishment in order to provide a hall under the main church. It has always attracted large congregations & its focus has always been to teach the Christian faith.",

                "All Souls Church was built as a result of the Government's  Church Building Act of 1818 for ‘promoting the building of additional churches in populous parishes’. The sum of £1M was allocated, with a limit of £20,000 to which each Vestry could apply.",
                "Marylebone Vestry quickly applied and was granted Crown land at the south end of Portland Place. John Nash was already developing the Regent Street area and made sure that he was appointed to design the church, as the site would resolve his problem of how to join the new Regent Street up to Portland Place.  All Souls is Nash's only remaining church building.",
                "In 1940 a landmine exploded in Portland Place, lifting the roof of All Souls and damaging its spire.  The building was declared unsafe, and was not re-opened until 1951.",
                "In the 1970's the need for extra space at the Church became acute.  The church architect, Robert Potter discovered John Nash's original 13 foot inverted brick arches.  The decision was made to build a Hall under the Church.  The congregation took on the project and raised most of the funds themselves. They were delighted when the new Waldegrave Hall, with a kitchen, dining room and cloakroom was re-opened in 2nd November 1976.",
                "The stonework and interior has been repaired many times over the years, but in 2023 the need for a new roof became critical.  Once again the church was swathed in scaffolding and emerged with a new roof and cleaned and repaired stonework."
