Our proposal for the redevelopment of Cockpit’s studio building in Deptford was supported by the Mayor of London’s Good Growth Fund and the Stride partnership. Completed in early summer 2024, the project makes Cockpit more publicly accessible and creates new workshop and studio space for makers.",

The key architectural move is a dramatic 6m-wide opening-up of the 21m-long, 3.5m-high brick wall to the street, transforming what was previously an inaccessible, underused front yard into a new craft garden which serves as a welcoming gateway, housing a new public entrance, flexible educational spaces, a café and a revamped leatherworkers’ hub. This gives Cockpit Deptford a permanent public presence for the first time, making it more open, active, inviting and accessible."
