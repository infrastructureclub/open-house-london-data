We use our mission to collect, preserve and celebrate the histories of people of African and Caribbean descent in the UK and to inspire and give strength to individuals, communities and society. This tour of our site gives audiences an overview of the historical context in which we were founded, as well as the specific mission of our founders, including the iconic Len Garrison. After the tour, enjoy free entry to our current exhibition Over a Barrel: Windrush Children, Tragedy and Triumph celebrating the incredible journeys of children who travelled from the Caribbean to the UK during the Windrush era."
