Abney Park, acting as the “white light”, offers fresh perspectives on works by 10 designers, emphasising collaboration and innovation.",
                "Situated in WAX Atelier’s open studio within the newly renovated Abney Park, one of London's 'Magnificent Seven' garden cemeteries, the installation invites exploration into design and material innovation. Featuring a diverse array of tools, material samples, and objects by established and emerging designers, the showcase highlights tree-derived materials such as oils, waxes, resins, and dyes, demonstrating their transformation into innovative design and craft objects.",
                "'The Abney Effect' unfolds as a metaphorical journey illustrating how nature, process, and creativity intersect in unexpected ways. It provides an immersive experience that celebrates the dynamic interplay between these materials and their potential outcomes, offering visitors a deeper understanding of their significance in contemporary design and craft."
