                "Broadwater Farm is a council-owned housing estate, built in 1967-73. Inspired by Le Corbusier, the estate was the flagship housing project of the new London Borough of Haringey. It contained more than 1,000 flats and housed more than 3,000 people. By the mid-1970s, design faults and a lack of amenities were becoming apparent. However, by mid-1980s, a series of initiatives had started to improve the estate's reputation. Much of this was thanks to the Broadwater Farm Youth Association (BFYA) who campaigned for and successfully commissioned a community centre, a day nursery, a women's centre and a children's play centre on the estate, as well as artworks across the estate. On 6 October 1985 Broadwater Farm made national headlines as the scene of a riot. The riot was one of several episodes of civil unrest occurring in the early 1980s against the background of economic inequality and institutional racism faced disproportionately by black and multi-ethnic communities. In response to the events of October 1985, the Youth Association and Haringey Council coordinated a programme of improvements, which included commissioning external community murals and two landscaped gardens. The estate is now undergoing a period of transformational investment and regeneration, with the demolition and replacing of two blocks, 300 new homes to be built, two pilot block refurbishments, and public realm and landscape proposals."
