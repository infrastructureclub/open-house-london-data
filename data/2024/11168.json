                "Nubia Way will be the site of the oral history photo exhibition  and documentary 'Tomorrow is Built Today' where you can watch vintage footage of the opening of Nubia Way as well as testimony from the self-builders of all 3 Fusions  Jameen inspired schemes. Including the most cost effective of all the self-build for rent scheme the women-led 14 home Chinbrook Meadow scheme designed to accommodate the naturalisation of the Quaggy River.",
                "The self-builders share their personal views on the rewards and challenges of meeting their family's housing need through a group effort.",
                "You will also  be able to hear testimony from experts in housing finance, cost control, building procurement and community empowerment  on how an innovative mutli-disciplinary approach was required to maximise the participation of the self-builders in the creation  their eco social housing communities.",
                "Discover how Nubia Way dealt with racist arson attacks and worked to restore a disused ancient woodland with the  local community and schools. Hear how the community self-build led to  wider neighbourhood regeneration with the  Downham community land trust working in partnership with  local GP's to develop the Downham Health Through Sport, Leisure and Nature Strategy. \nhttps://vimeo.com/732795269/a6fcc9eeb4",
                "Fusions Jameen were inspired by the African and Caribbean parents and  leaders of yesterday. We invite you  to explore what lessons  their inspirational achievements have for the next generation's challenge of meeting their need for green social housing. Come discover how the tomorrow we seek can be built today"
