                "Designed by G Val Myer and built in 1932, Broadcasting House is the BBC’s famous HQ, and a symbol of its radio broadcasting.",
                "Made of Portland stone, its central heavy masonry tower contains all the radio studios, while a lighter steel-framed 'shell' provides acoustic buffering.",
                "With its accentuated Art Deco front section bearing a clock tower and aerial mast, the building has often been compared to a ship – in particular one of those streamlined1930s ocean liners. Artistic commissions adorn the building - in particular the sculptures of Ariel and Prospero by Eric Gill.",
                "In 2006/2013, the building was majorly refurbished and extended to create a new Broadcasting House.",
                "Broadcasting House is highly significant as the first purpose-built broadcast centre in the UK.",
                "This landmark building symbolised the confident arrival of radio at the heart of national life – and indeed before it was even completed, it was already too small for its fast expanding workforce.",
                "Countless famous broadcasts have come from Broadcasting House over the years, from hugely popular and long-running radio shows such as The Goons and Desert Island Discs to Woman’s Hour and You and Yours.",
                "It is now the centre for national and international news, and the largest live newsroom in Europe sits at the heart of its new complex. National radio network commissioning also comes from this building. It is also the national HQ, with the office of the BBC Chairman and Director-General based here."
