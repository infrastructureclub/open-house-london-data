Financed through a mix of philanthropy and creative capitalism, the new community included housing for the growing number of middle-class working women and live-in training for those less well-off.  Preserved buildings provide an opportunity to examine what society deemed 'appropriate'  for women at a time when the class structure was at its most rigid."
