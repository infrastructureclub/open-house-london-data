Starting with a wreck and with an equally passionate client, we have been able to explore, research and innovate to achieve the lowest carbon solutions we could find to reduce the carbon impact of the build as well as the in-use carbon. With a whole-house retrofit, three extensions, low-energy heating solutions including heat pump, MVHR, and solar panels, and a sustainable interior with low to zero-emission materials and finishes, topped with an eco-garden, this project has it all."
