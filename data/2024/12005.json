                "From the Romans onwards, the City of London has been dominated by men. The tour enables you to learn about the history of women in the City by celebrating the lives and achievements of some remarkable individuals. These include: Boudicca; an unknown Roman girl buried under a skyscraper; some Medieval nuns who broke the rules; the 18th century feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft; 18th century entrepreneur Eleanor Coade; Victorian cookery writer Mrs Beeton and the Suffragettes. You will visit places connected with these women, and hear their stories."
