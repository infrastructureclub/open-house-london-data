                "The Christ Church Community Centre was developed, through a sensitive and contextual design, to enable this established Grade II listed church on Highbury Fields to better serve its local community. \nChrist Church Highbury is an early Victorian listed Church of England landmark, sitting right at the top of Highbury Fields in Islington. The church itself has stood the test of time to serve its congregation, but in recent decades it has lacked suitable spaces to provide facilities and outreach to the wider community. It was therefore decided that the adjoining vicarage’s oversized garden should be divided, to create a site for a brand-new accessible and sustainable building for this purpose. \nMatthew Lloyd Architects worked closely over several years with the Church community to create this sensitive design for new community building within this highly contextual and historic setting. Designed within very tight planning constraints, the new building provides a divisible multi-purpose space, a café and a public-facing Church office, all entered from a newly landscaped church forecourt.\nThe single-storey fully accessible building draws on its local historic and park context to inspire its choice of materials and details. It has excellent daylight and natural ventilation, and a living green roof currently in bloom with wild flowers.  Its walls are clad in curving, thin linear brickwork in a colour to exactly match original stone of the church itself with windows and its roof capping in bronze coloured powder-coated aluminium."
