For centuries its importance lay in the Horse Ferry river crossing and waterside activities, potteries, factories and light industry, reaching its peak in the late 19th century. \nChanges in sanitation and then the 1956 Clear Air Act changed the district, only to transform gradually over a fifty year period, resulting in the mix of style, architecture and use we see today"

Between the two, a 'moderne' facade with detailing by Gilbert Bayes, followed by a Victorian terracotta gem, repurposed as contemporary workspace. We reveal reminders of the old village of Lambeth, and see a site of public health history, highlight reuse with an arty backdrop, including the 2016 Stirling Award winning design for Damien Hirst's  Newport Street Gallery before ending after doing the Lambeth Walk - in Paradise!"
