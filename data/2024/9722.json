Inside this space is material related to his life and work, as well as other science related objects, all from Southwark’s Cuming museum collections.  Faraday is considered the greatest scientific experimentalist who ever lived. Fundamentally, his research into the magnetic field around a conductor established the basis for the electromagnetic field in physics. This is crucial in harnessing electrical power, which drives the technology we rely on today."
