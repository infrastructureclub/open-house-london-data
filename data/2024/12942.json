She will recount her inspiring story of starting with little DIY experience, gaining training, learning how to hang doors, and eventually running her own construction business after completing the scheme. Hear how her confidence grew as she negotiated the installation of solar panels and the inter generational impact of the self-build, with her son later building his own home, inspired by the leadership roles Charmaine embraced."
