                "In 1870 the Enfield Burial Board was established to address a shortage of burial space within St Andrew’s Churchyard. The Board soon acquired a large piece of land near the top of Lavender Hill and set about constructing a new cemetery. The work was carried out under the supervision of Thomas J. Hill, who designed two gothic chapels (one for the Anglicans, one for the nonconformists) as well as the entrance lodge, walls and gates.",
                "The two chapels form a picturesque matching pair and are constructed of rock-faced stone with ashlar dressings in a Gothic Revival style. Unusually, the nonconformist chapel incorporated a curved metal urinal with embossed panels and decorative bands (which has been removed for safe keeping).",
                "In 1990, the heritage value of the western chapel (nonconformist), eastern chapel (Anglican), the cemetery lodge and attached railings and gates, was recognised by Historic England who designated them Grade II listed buildings.",
                "Memorials within the cemetery include a chest tomb to the Bosanquet family, a granite vault to Heinrich Faulenbach, and a Celtic cross to Benjamin Godfrey."
