                "Situated between Teddington and Richmond, the weir comprises three vertical steel sluice gates suspended from a footbridge. Each gate weighs 32 tons and is 66 feet wide and 12 feet in depth.",
                "For around two hours each side of high tide, the weir gates are raised into the footbridge structure above, allowing vessels to pass through the barrage. For the rest of the tide the weir gates are closed and passing river traffic must use the lock alongside the barrage.",
                "The weir gates ensure that the water level between Richmond Lock and Teddington Lock is maintained at or above half-tide level.",
                "The structure was officially opened by the Duke and Duchess of York in 1894.",
                "PLA completed a major, £4 million refurbishment of the lock and weir in the early 1990s."
