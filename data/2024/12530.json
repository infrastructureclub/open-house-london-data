By engaging with the space the community can bring life and vibrancy back to the area.\n \nTo initiate the use of this space, the Summer on the Green Programme, hosted at the Pavilion, celebrates Edmonton's cultural diversity. It provides local community members with opportunities to showcase their stories and projects.",
                "The hope is that the Pavilion, during its temporary presence on The Green, will act as a catalyst for regular visits by local people. This can help build social cohesion and develop the social infrastructure that can ripple a positive transformation throughout the area. The vision is to create an \"Everyday Experience\" of The Green, encouraging locals to come together through a consistent rhythm of small, regular activities every week."
