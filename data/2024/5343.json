                "Founded in 1933 by Dr. Alfred Wiener, the Wiener Holocaust Library is the world’s oldest Holocaust memorial institution. It was initially set up to collect and disseminate information about events happening in Nazi Germany.",
                "Having moved to London in 1939, Dr Wiener’s collection proved invaluable, first to the British government and later, after the War, to the UN War crimes commission. Now a forum for research and scholarly debate, the Library is also known for gathering and compiling thousands of eyewitness accounts.",
                "The Library’s current holdings number approximately 65,000 books and pamphlets, as well as periodicals, unpublished memoirs, photographs, press cuttings, and rare material obtained from all over the world."

                "In 2010 the Library acquired from Birkbeck, University of London, a 99-year lease on a substantial but dilapidated listed Georgian building, located at 29 Russell Square, in the heart of Bloomsbury. This has now been carefully refurbished and converted by Barbara Weiss Architects, to accommodate the collection in elegant, accessible, and climate controlled conditions – part of a £5m project intended to prepare the Library to play a more prominent role in British and international academic life.",
                "The move is very much seen by the Library as the foundation for ensuring the appropriate conditions for its future work in scholarship, public policy and education relating to the study of the Holocaust, antisemitism and comparative genocide.",
                "Having started its existence as an information service to counteract Nazi propaganda, the Library is now aiming at helping new and existing audiences to engage fully with the collections; a substantial grant from the Heritage Lottery fund is specifically destined for outreach programmes, such as the main exhibition in the ground floor reception."
