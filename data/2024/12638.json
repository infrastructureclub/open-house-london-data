                "Preparing for war:\nThe Little Ship Club was already established as the leading training organisation for navigation and seamanship in small craft and much of the instruction was in the hands of former naval officers. It was quite natural then for the Admiralty to turn to the Little Ship Club for help in training a Royal Naval Supplementary Volunteer Reserve. This effort was formally recognised in 1937 when the Admiralty awarded the Club a warrant to fly a defaced blue ensign - the Club is the only organisation ever to have been invited to apply for a warrant."
