Bermondsey therefore, situated South of the river outside the city walls, was a hub of leather production. It was referred to by some as the ‘land of leather’. Dickens said on one of his visits to Bermondsey that the ‘air reeks with evil smells’. \nThe air now smells of fresh coffee and perhaps a hint of ink!\nTanner Street’s history goes even further back - one of the oldest streets in Bermondsey, it was originally called Five Foot Lane in 1544."
