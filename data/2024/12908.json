                "Sir John Morden made his fortune working in Aleppo in Syria as a factor, trading in spices.  for the Levant Company.  He and his wife had no children of their own to leave their money to and he decided to create Morden College as an almshouse for “decayed” merchants i.e. having fallen on hard times through no fault of their own. They had to be single or widowed, over 50 with no family to help them and practising members of the Church of England and were given a flat, cloak, coals, servants and an allowance. In 1699 Sir John bought the Manor of Old Court, as the endowment to fund the College. The Manor comprised tracts of Greenwich which have been carefully managed by the Trustees. Under their administration, leases were granted. The Quadrangle was designed as flats for 40 men. The first five beneficiaries came into residence in 1700. The College was in the care of 7 Trustees with day-to-day administration by the Treasurer and Chaplain. Lady Morden, when she died, left £100 to be invested for the benefit of the chaplain. The Trustees used this money to buy a plot of land on the south side of the heath which yielded substantial rents for its beneficiary. Over the years many changes have come in such as Charity Commission schemes, relaxation of entrance criteria, admission of married couples and single women. There has been expansion of residential accommodation plus the addition of a dining room, library, club house and a care home and most recently the John Morden Centre."

Resident beneficiaries of an almshouse pay a ‘contribution’ that is usually monthly and goes toward the maintenance and upkeep of their accommodation."
