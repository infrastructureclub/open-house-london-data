                "This artificial slope was realised with Turkish Travertine slabs, the golden colour of which recalls a beach, leading to the 'beach house' nickname for the project.",
                "The low walls were made from rendered blockwork, left unpainted  as it was on the whole of the rear facade.",
                "Visitors will be able to see how the pictures of the completed project taken in 2012 differ from how the house is today, as nature has taken its course."
