It has been a centre for settlement, trade, commerce and ceremony since the Roman period, producing a unique historic environment of exceptional richness and significance. Only around 8000 residents live in just over one square mile. On weekdays more than half a million people work in the City. Additionally, it has 10m annual visitors. The City boundaries stretch from Temple to the Tower of London, on the River Thames including, from west to east Chancery Lane and Liverpool Street"
