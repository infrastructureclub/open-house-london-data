                "In the turbulent sixteenth and seventeenth centuries people demanded the reform of the English Church. Believing it had left the simple message of the Bible some formed independent gatherings.  Some of these separatists, studying the Bible, adopted believer’s baptism and became known as Baptists.  Meeting usually in houses or barns because of the religious and political conditions (for example that led to the Pilgrim Fathers emigrating to the New World) building prominent buildings was impossible and illegal.\nToleration improved over two centuries and by the end of the Victorian era non-conformist churches, including Baptists, were both numerous and influential in many communities, not least in the new suburbs of North London."

Muswell Hill Baptist Church is one of many examples of the new status of non-conformity in late Victorian and Edwardian England.  It is as unmistakeably a ‘church’ as the parish church would be.",
                "It was commissioned by the London Baptist Association for the new suburb.  Baptists were already meeting in a nearby school.  The land was given by one of Muswell Hill’s key developers, James Edmondson – it is understood land was originally offered lower down Dukes Avenue but more central land was requested and granted.",
                "Baptist Churches are locally governed and funded so it was the congregation's responsibility to raise the funds and loans to build the chapel.  Such was the eventual expense that an early minister had to resign the pastorate when the church lacked the funds to pay him due to the debt."

Baines was prolific as an architect of the fast-developing chapels, particularly in his native Lancashire and in London where he became established.  About 100 of his non-conformist chapels remain in use.  They are varied but share certain features.",
                "A Baines chapel is typically light with large windows.  The general layout emphasises the centrality of preaching (and congregational singing) and often creates a sense of space with high ceilings.  Many small decorative features enhance the general plainness and simplicity, in keeping with Edwardian taste."
