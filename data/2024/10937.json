                "Originally founded as a government art school, it is now an independent, not-for-profit charity, and is one of the country's longest established art schools. It offers courses ranging from art and design Foundation, through to BA (Hons) undergraduate degrees and MA postgraduate courses in fine art, carving, conservation, and art histories. In addition, it offers the only undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in Britain in stone and wood carving:  architectural stone and ornamental woodcarving & gilding.",
                "Established to teach the techniques of the specialist crafts and focused on developing skills required in the artisan manufacturing industries, since then, it has evolved and expanded its educational programmes, offering an alternative approach to that provided in most other art schools we play a vital role in passing on specialist craft skills and inspiring new generations of artists and makers to create new works, and to restore and conserve precious built and cultural heritage of the past, for all to see and enjoy."

Arts education therefore should not be a privilege, but something that anyone can access and use to empower themselves and those around them."
