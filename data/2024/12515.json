An iconic building in East London that has changed use with the movement through time. However it holds the charm of when it was built in 1924,. It was a resting place for sailors when in the London Docks for decades before becoming a hostel for the homeless or immigrants until the 1980's when it was converted to homes. People are keen to see what is behind the big blue doors and amazed to see our wonderful courtyard and the vista's of the city. We would like to share this with the community and welcome everyone to explore the building and take in the history and charm."
