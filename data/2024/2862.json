                "The third Earl of Burlington (1694-1753) designed the elegant Classical villa seen today, drawing inspiration from his 'grand tours' of Italy. It was originally located in a modest estate purchased by his grandfather, next to an existing Jacobean house.",
                "The villa was more a showcase for the arts rather than a home, and it provided a spectacular venue for entertaining. During his travels Burlington met the architect William Kent and invited him to collaborate on the design of the villa. William Kent also designed the gardens and started the influential 'English Landscape Movement'.",
                "By the 1770s Chiswick had passed to the fifth Duke of Devonshire who initiated a series of major changes to both house and garden, demolishing the earlier Jacobean house and adding new wings to the villa. These were subsequently removed in the 1950s.",
                "As the home of successive members of Lord Burlington's family, including Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, Chiswick House has welcomed scores of significant guests over the years, including the musician Handel, the politician Charles James Fox, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.",
                "In the 1950s Chiswick House was passed to the Ministry of Works, via Middlesex Council, and a much needed restoration campaign was undertaken. The villa has been cared for by English Heritage since 1984, who, with the Chiswick House and Gardens Trust, set up in 2005, embarked on a major restoration programme which breathed new life into the House and wider Gardens."
