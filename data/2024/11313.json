We explore how the area evolved from a kitchen garden to a giant wholesale produce market and was supplying clients throughout the UK. We look at one locality which supplied a variety of peripheral services to the market, as well the residential areas in latter years. At the same time highlighting the struggle to keep the area intact on the departure of the wholesale market and the impact  on the local inhabitants and businesses as well as the area.",
