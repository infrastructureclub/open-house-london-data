A galvanised steel and timber staircase, elevated above the wharf’s wild zone, takes you down to the pontoon. The pontoon is offset from the historic red brick canal wall, which has enabled us to reintroduce native reeds and other water borne plants and insert corrugated steel planters for herbaceous plants and climbers.",

You may spot our resident cats out and about around the wharf, Jiji, Louis, and Newt: please be gentle!",

The steel hull was built in 1991 by Colecraft Engineering Ltd.\nDodgily named and dodgily decorated, inside she’s a much-loved floating patchwork of donated furniture, things found in skips, unfinished DIY and bodge jobs. Freezing in winter, boiling in summer, she’s a perfect vantage point to spy on all the dramas of the canal and towpath. I once gave myself a concussion walking in to the cabin, so mind your head."

Wooden steps (which also function as storage drawers) descend into the galley/kitchen  of an open plan living area with a wood stove and sofa. The main cabin is divided from the sleeping area at the front of the boat by a bathroom cabin with a curved wall. The boat has five large bus-style windows plus two large (15”) portholes. In addition to the rear hatch entrance there is a side hatch and doors opening to the front deck."
