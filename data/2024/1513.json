Originally owned by the Earls of Burlington, it was purchased by the government in 1854, and it served as the headquarters of various learned societies. In 1867, the Royal Academy was granted a 999-year lease. It then erected its top-lit Main Galleries, art school and a third floor, all designed by architect Sidney Smirke RA.",
                "In 2001, the Royal Academy purchased 6 Burlington Gardens, located directly north of Burlington House. With Heritage Lottery Funding, a new, central route between the sites united the two-acre campus in 2018, the product of a transformational redevelopment by Sir David Chipperfield RA. The final stage of this project was the restoration and modernisation of the Royal Academy Schools, which was completed in May 2024."
