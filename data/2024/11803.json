The Open Day offers an opportunity to connect with ourselves  and others, relax with speciality teas, learn meditation techniques, and connect with our inner peace.",

There will be guided tours of the shrine rooms exploring Tibetan Buddhist paraphernalia and their spiritual significance. The tearoom will be serving  homemade cakes and savouries, speciality teas and other refreshments. Visitors are also invited to browse the shop selling Buddhist books and gifts.",
                "Who we are and what we offer",

                "Meditation and Compassion through to traditional Buddhist studies",
                "Our courses and programmes share meditation techniques and methods for training in compassion, which have been developed over centuries, yet help us deal with the challenges of everyday life. Meditation and compassion have been shown to be beneficial in many different ways, including bringing peace of mind, tackling stress, depression and other mental health problems. They can also help us to develop more kindness and warm-heartedness for ourselves, our families and those around us.",
                "For those who wish to go deeper into studying and practising Buddhism, Rigpa also offers study and practice programs including courses in the Vajrayana Buddhist tradition of Tibet.",
                "We invite teachers of all traditions",
                "A unique feature of Rigpa UKâ€™s event programme is that it regularly hosts teachers of all Tibetan Buddhist traditions as well as Buddhist masters of other lineages, and teachers from different spiritual traditions."
