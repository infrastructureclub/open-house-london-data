                "We recently received a £30k community carbon reduction grant from Tower Hamlets council which was used to purchase and install an array of 54 solar panels (23 kWp) covering our entire Pier House roof. The array was commissioned on 24 September 2023 and has generated so far more than 6,200 kWh or the equivalent of almost 2 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions saved (or around 3.5 trees)."
