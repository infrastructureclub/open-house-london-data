                "The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw considerable innovation and rapid change in Croydon.  By chance, an itinerant watercolourist, Evacustes Phipson, was engaged by Croydon Reference Library to record ancient and old buildings particularly those under threat of loss. Museum of Croydon possesses over 300 works by Phipson, with some 50 Croydon scenes on display at this exhibition. Some of buildings depicted have been demolished but some remain.",
