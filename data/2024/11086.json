This was all lost when the site was left as an empty void after the Exhibition Centres were demolished.\nIt is now a physical barrier between communities. But at circa 40 acres and superbly well-connected, today it is London’s most important Opportunity Area.",

It will support two million skilled jobs by 2030.\n- Earls Court will create a home for this industry with a workspace ecosystem supporting start-ups, scale ups and multinationals.",
