                "Methodists have had a presence in London's West End from the earliest days of the Methodist movement. A leased chapel in West Street (which can still be seen, just off Cambridge Circus) was used from 1743, and John and Charles Wesley themselves preached there. \nIn 1808 land close by in Marylebone was acquired to build a chapel, on part of the site now occupied by the present Hinde Street building.  The chapel, opened in 1810, held around 900, had two galleries and acquired the nickname ‘The Dutch Oven’ because of its shape.\nCharles Wesley had lived nearby in Chesterfield Street, Marylebone (now Wheatley Street), and a son and daughter were members of the new chapel.\nHinde Street's West End location attracted the foremost preachers in Methodism, and its pulpit gained a formidable reputation. Membership peaked at 1,100 in 1844 .\nThe old chapel was demolished in the 1880's and the present chapel, built to the designs of James Weir, is regarded as his finest building. It opened on 29 September 1887.  It is listed, Grade 2."

                "Hinde Street is one of the more lavish Methodist chapels in the city, and possibly in the country.\nBuilt to the designs of James Weir (previously an assistant of Norman Shaw), it is regarded as his most accomplished work.  The recent redecoration and relighting of the chapel have revealed its true elegance.\nThe chapel has a classical frontage - the Historic England Listing referring to it as having \"English Baroque references\" - especially in the 2-storeyed, pedimented entrance portico which is \"reminiscent of St. Paul's Cathedral\". Rising over the western corner is a 3-stage octagonal tower and spire.  \nThe interior remains largely unaltered save for removal of the original downstairs pews in the 1979 and the construction of a new entrance foyer in 2014. \nThe semi-circular gallery (with its original pews) and high central pulpit are typical of Methodist preaching chapels of its time. The east window of three lights (1929) is by Francis Spear.  The organ is basically the original 1864 instrument by Bishop and Sons, rebuilt in 1910 and 1983.\nThe entrance lobby was altered in 2014 to enable the original panelled wooden doors to be left open throughout the day, with new glass doors giving passers by a view into the chapel, The new foyer is more spacious but retains the timber framed glazed panels of the original lobby at high level."
