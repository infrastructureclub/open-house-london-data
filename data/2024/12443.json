In it's younger days it was not only the place of worship for the area but the government, the police, and the social workers. Records exist in the church archives that tell us all of this was true, and some of these will be on display for Open House London.",
                "The interior of the church is almost cathedral like; with a huge stained glass window above the altar. The walls are covered in memorials to those who are resting here, and show the great diversity of parishioners over the years. St. Luke's was (and still is) home to single mothers,  people of colour, famous authors and actors, the working class, and the wealthy."
