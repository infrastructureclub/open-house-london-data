In the entrance hall we removed a landing so that there is a view up into the new loft extension and this allows light to flood into the home from the moment you enter. The existing ground floor extension was removed and replaced with a larger building incorporating an atrium at its centre that allows daylight to flood into the basement rooms below.  The two-storey living wall accentuates the scale of this focal point in the house."

The key improvement is to create a large house in which al the rooms are day-lit and naturally ventilated.  The arrangement of the house also creates a house for the future in which different generations of the family may live together."
