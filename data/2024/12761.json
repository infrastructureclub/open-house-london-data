                "The project is a test bed for the use of timber to create character. Deep, rhythmic red fins sit atop a pigmented blockwork bench and contrast with fine silver grey larch boards. Internally, warm douglas fir beams and boards are interspersed with diamond skylights that cast light patterns into the kitchen. Primary colours highlight the joinery, with the blue column, yellow bookshelf and terracotta red staircase enlivening the space. The secret courtyard garden is designed as an outdoor room, picking up on the language of rhythmic piers that give the exterior a striking presence. Externally the timber frame slides beyond the fa√ßade to form a bench that catches the midday sun.",
                "With cost and carbon in mind, the projects was designed to be constructed out of readily available, cost effective and low carbon materials. It extends the life of a poorly built aspect home, improving insulation, creating cross ventilation and maximising daylight on the north elevation."
