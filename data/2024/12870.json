David Kohn Architectsâ€™ tiered extension responds to the richness of the surrounding roof lines, and the robust of the existing commercial building beneath.",
                "Each storey steps back to reflect changing scales from multi-storey offices to domestic almshouses, with bayed facades that further engage with the architectural language of their surroundings while breaking up the massing of the extension. This respectful design approach clearly distinguishes old from new, and allows the subsidiary relationship of the new apartment to its host to be understood. Inside, the series of step-backs and bays creates rooms with unique qualities, as well as various views, light and spaces.",
                "The design features a series of outdoor private terraces on each tier of the apartment, that when planted, will create a luxuriant green foil for the development in a Babylonian-style hanging garden."
