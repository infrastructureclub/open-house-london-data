                "Recently developed by Mitsubishi Real Estate and Stanhope, 8 Bishopsgate provides an exciting opportunity to visit the latest contribution to the City of London’s cluster of tall buildings. Designed by WilkinsonEyre, the 50-storey office-led tower provides flexible retail space at the lower levels and extensive amenities for tenants throughout the building. \n \nThe overall form of the tower has been informed by several factors, including the context of the City cluster and protected local views from Fleet Street of St. Paul’s dome. A stepped profile satisfies these requirements and breaks down the overall scale and mass of the building into a legible form. The design features generous roof terraces and a publicly accessible viewing gallery on the top floor, providing magnificent views across London.\n \nThe building includes high sustainability/low energy initiatives in its construction and operation and has achieved a BREEAM ‘Outstanding’ rating. 8 Bishopsgate is understood to be the most sustainable speculative tall commercial scheme in the UK."
