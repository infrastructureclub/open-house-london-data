                "The north of Westminster is an area rich in stories of how the local community has influenced the built environment. This walking tour explores the stories of how the cityscape we see today has been shaped by different ideological approaches, by local campaigns and the push and pull of battles for housing and amenities. With a particular emphasis on housing, the walking tour considers artisan cottage dwellings and Victorian terraces of 19th century as well as the streets-in-the-sky approach of post war period.  It also looks at how, following Margaret Thatcherâ€™s election to power in 1979, the wider ideological battles of the 1980s between left and right were played out in north Paddington.  Led by a local resident, it will explore the question of who decides what gets built and who is it for?"
