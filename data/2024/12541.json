This tour explores how the cityscape we see today has been shaped by different ideological approaches, local campaigns and the push and pull of battles for housing and amenities. It considers the question of who decides what gets built and who is it for?",

We will revisit the response of the local residents to the building of the Westway and consider the provision of local green space.  The tour will include artisan cottage dwellings of the 19th century and the extent to which they pre-empted the garden city movement; Victorian and Edwardian streetscapes, the stories of those who lived there and those who collected the rent; and the streets-in-the-sky approach of the post war period. We will also look at how, following Margaret Thatcher’s election to power in 1979, the wider ideological battles of the 1980s between left and right were played out in 2 north Paddington housing estates, with a visible legacy today.  Throughout, we will consider who made the decisions and what local people had to say about it."
