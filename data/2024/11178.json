                "In 2022, Building D2 joined the cluster of experimental buildings in London‘s Design District, complete with a facade clad in colour-shifting shades and a structure made from cross-laminated timber.",
                "Designed by local practice Mole Architects, the “D2” building forms part of the area’s wider innovative architectural landscape. It is the second of the studio’s structures in the area, which also features buildings by the likes of Selgas Cano and 6A Architects.",
                "D2 takes its visual cues from the history of Greenwich Peninsula – specifically when the area was home to Europe’s largest gasworks.",
                "Its petrol-toned cladding makes the building a clear standout amongst the architecture nearby, despite being one of the site’s smallest. Not only striking from the outside, but its interior also reveals the innovative building method used to construct its core. In order to radically reduce carbon footprint, the architects opted for cross-laminated timber in place of concrete – which uses half the energy of concrete structures to build, and also acts as carbon stores that lock CO2 into the fabric of the building."
