                "Known outside the locale as The Bishops Avenueâ€™s more restrained, less bombastic sibling, Winnington Road is the most expensive, and least architecturally coherent street in the Hampstead Garden Suburb. Its development, begun in 1930, and not yet abated, encompasses an unrivalled variety of Neo-Georgian domestic architecture. How has the street evolved, and how could it have ended up? Join Calum Orr, an Architectural Adviser to the Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust, on this walking tour as we take a peek behind the privet for a colourful look at the history and architecture of this well-heeled fringe of a suburban utopia, and pick through the fruits of a recently-completed and exhaustive survey, looking to reappraise the form of the street, and its changes over the past century."
