Among past residents are Caxton, Milton, Hazlitt, Bentham, JS Mill, Elgar and  Dick Turpin. Holden's 1927 London Underground HQ introduced American skyscraper technology and style to  London.  We shall see how the young Henry Moore and and Jacob Epstein sculpted into its Portland stone. Basil Spence, hero of El Alamein, renowned for rebuilding Coventry Cathedral, was commissioned to create a new Home Office building to withstand the IRA. Facing which are the 1704 terraces which gave the world the Queen Anne Townhouse model."
