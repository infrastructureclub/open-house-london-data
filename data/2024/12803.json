This assemblage of drawings, materials and photography - bringing together early concept sketches, samples and 1:1 scale test models – exposes the twists, about-turns and serendipity that informed these award-winning projects, and examines and celebrates the idea that the best ideas take a journey of their own. Guided tours available."
