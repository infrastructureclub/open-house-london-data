                "A transformational project for English National Ballet (ENB) saw rehearsal and administration functions move from West to East London and into London City Island in 2019, into what would in 2020 be named the Mulryan Centre for Dance.",
                "The new building significantly expands on the capabilities of ENB's historic West London accommodation by providing eight new rehearsal spaces, one of which has full stage rigging facilities which can be used as a performance space in its own right.",
                "The design of the building has opened up the activities of ENB to the public through the incorporation of large windows onto public spaces and through external performance spaces. At London City Island, the Mulryan Centre for Dance is situated amidst six colourful and eye catching GHA buildings. In contrast, English National Ballet's headquarters stand as a translucent, lightweight structure where the masonry blocks give the appearance of revealing a striking glimpse of the island core."
