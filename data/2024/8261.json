At London City Island, the Mulryan Centre for Dance is situated amidst six colourful and eye catching GHA buildings. In contrast, English National Ballet's headquarters stand as a translucent, lightweight structure where the masonry blocks give the appearance of revealing a striking glimpse of the island core."
