We will go to Denmark Street to look at the buildings used as recording studios, where the Rolling Stones, Black Sabbath and The Sex Pistols all worked (amongst many others), and the music shops where the likes of Eric Clapton and Hendrix bought their guitars. \nThe walk will also include St Annes Court to see the old Trident Studios building where Hey Jude was recorded as well as Bowie's first three albums, and the two different sites of the famous Marquee Club, where the tour's host Tom Lawes once worked as a sound engineer over 30 years ago. \nThe tours will start at 12.00, 14.00 and 16.00\nThe tour will last up to one hour"
