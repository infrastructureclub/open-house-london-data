This is realised by visiting the locations they worked from or the memorials raised to them.",

It seeks to go beyond Churchill, about whom many walks on the topic tend to focus.",
                "The walk considers British engagement in the war by considering \n•\tthe role of women in the war;\n•\tthe scale and importance of rationing;\n•\tthe leadership offered by Churchill, Mountbatten, George VI and the Queen Mum, \n•\tinternational leadership emanating from London such as De Gaulle and Free France, D-Day Planning with Eisenhower, and early moves which ultimately led to the United Nations; and\n•\tthe scale of subterfuge by considering encryption and decryption as well as the role of spies and deception.",
                "The focus of the walk is on the historic events that occurred in buildings (those which remain) and personalities commemorated through public sculptures, but some buildings (Admiralty Citadel, War Rooms) marry form and function and so are part of the story."
