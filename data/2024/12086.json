                "Crystal Palace Subway is a beautifully designed and crafted relic of Victorian construction, hidden under Crystal Palace Parade. Constructed in 1865 to provide access to the Crystal Palace from the High Level Railway Station it is now listed Grade II* but, after more than 50 years as a ruined structure, the Subway was in a very poor condition until the current restoration works commenced.",
                "Located at the intersection of five London boroughs, the Grade II* Crystal Palace Subway first opened in 1865 to provide access to the Crystal Palace from the High-Level Station. The Subway is one of the last remaining features of the Crystal Palace following the 1936 fire, when the Victorian roof that covered the Subway’s East Courtyard was destroyed. Nevertheless, the Subway has been utilised by the community as a WW2 air-raid shelter and occasional event space.",
                "The £3.5 million project was the result of an amazing 14-year, community-led campaign, spearheaded by the Friends of Crystal Palace Subway, with the capital works led by Bromley Council and made possible thanks to generous funding from Historic England and the City of London Strategic Investment Pot."
