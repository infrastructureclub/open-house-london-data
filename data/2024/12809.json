It is a multi-use facility featuring areas for art, music, drama, dance/yoga and IT plus a cafe and a garden area. The building houses a day service (IMPACT Outreach Network) and a theatre company (IMPACT Theatre) for performers and artists with learning disabilities. IMPACT has been running for more than two decades. IMPACT Theatre was a recipient of the Queen's Award for Voluntary Service 2018."
