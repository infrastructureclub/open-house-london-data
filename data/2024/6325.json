The tower stand prominently within the renowned Broadgate business district, as part of a journey that started nearly 30 years ago. Since then, the business world has changed dramatically and so has Broadgate, constantly adapting and refreshing – helping the City hold its position as a global financial centre and providing companies with the facilities they need to succeed.",

                "At 33 stories, The Broadgate Tower ranks among London’s tallest structures. The office building features double-deck elevators and, thanks to side-mounted cores, desirable open floor plates. Located near Liverpool Street Station, the tower was built above rail tracks and shares a 2.3-acre deck with 201 Bishopsgate, its shorter counterpart. Structural steel struts crisscrossing the glass facades of both buildings give them a rigorous, expressive quality.",
                "A covered passageway with shops and cafes stretches between the two structures. Trees in and around the galleria help create a relaxed atmosphere. Sustainable features in both buildings include heat-recovery systems and lighting that dims in response to daylight levels.",
                "The Worshipful Company of Chartered Architects was so impressed with the contribution 201 Bishopsgate and The Broadgate Tower make to the City’s streetscape and skyline; it recognised the development with the New City Architecture Award. The Broadgate Tower was also named the Best Tall Building in Europe by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitats."
