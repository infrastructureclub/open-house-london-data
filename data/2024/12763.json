Extending into the loft space was also considered. \nMany possible layouts were explored before deciding on completely opening up the top \nfloor, creating an open plan kitchen / dining / living space, with an open stairway leading to \nit. \nIt was also decided to put in a glass landing to the open stairway, allowing daylight down to \nthe entrance. \nA new, finely crafted Douglas Fir stair screen connects the various levels, acting as \nhandrail, balustrade, and fire wall. \nTall floor to ceiling doors were installed on the bedroom level, accentuating the loftiness of \nthe spaces, and allowing more light through. \nThe kitchen is Knott Architects designed, with dyed concrete worktops, and birch ply units. \nThe Client was able to make it entirely bespoke, to their requirements, including a bridging \nshelf across the rear window, providing a place to perch and watch the world outside."
