Information leaflets will be available to guide visitors around the ground floor. A display of handling objects related to other School Board for London buildings contemporary to 10 Bowling Green Lane, and to when it was the headquarters of Zaha Hadid Architects, will be in the reception.

                "This Queen Anne-style building is Grade II listed and was completed in 1874 for the School Board for London, opening as the Bowling Green Lane School. The building was designed by E.R. Robson in collaboration with J.J. Stevenson. It retains much of its original Victorian layout and exterior. In the 1970s it ceased operating as a school and in the 1980s was divided up into artists' studios. It was once the international headquarters of Zaha Hadid Architects, beginning in 1985 when Zaha Hadid took up one of these studios. Her practice grew until it took over the whole building. Since 2022, it has been the home of the charity Zaha Hadid Foundation which is returning the building to educational uses through public exhibitions, research and a public programme of events."
