Migration is a pressing contemporary issue and is at the centre of polarised political and online debate. But there’s an underlying story of comings and goings stretching back many centuries. And this story goes to the heart of who we are today.",
                "The UK has thousands of museums, but unlike many other countries, from Australia to France, Brazil to the USA, we don’t have a permanent Migration Museum. The time is right for a highly relevant, accessible permanent visitor attraction that shines a light on who we are, where we come from and where we are going.",
