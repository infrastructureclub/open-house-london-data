TTB wanted to create an innovative centre for remaking and re-use, and bring new energy to this unloved space. \nThe project presented many challenges, not least agreeing a layout with the nearly 40 stakeholders, who all had different aspirations for this ambitious project. Additional challenges including achieving building control compliance within a significantly constrained space with a very limited budget.",
                "After 18 months of meetings, co-design workshops, and council presentations a design was agreed and the relevant drawings and documents were submitted for planning. Despite all the challenges and thanks to the tenacity of the team involved, planning was awarded in 2013 and work got underway on an ambitious community self-build programme.",
