Five to six storey buildings of recent construction and mixed use occupy the former site of an industrial sawmill to the west and a clothing factory to the north. A large rectangular courtyard with high brick boundary walls forms part of the site.",

In the 1970’s it was converted to residential use and subdivided into three independent flats. As part of this conversion, an external stair was added to the rear façade to connect the upper floors."
