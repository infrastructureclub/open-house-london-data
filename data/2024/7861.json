Resident artists can use the ground floor as work studios for their own practices as well as for the public programme, while the apartments offer co-housing possibilities. Each set of three apartments shares a communal outdoor space scaled for eating and working together, as well as access. One floor of apartments has double doors in the party walls, creating optional and flexible shared living possibilities, such as for parties, childcare or co-working."

The public programme includes the provision of skills and creative expertise for the local community, helping to remove barriers to arts engagement and foster inclusive, creative ways of using civic spaces.",

The idea for A House for Artists emerged when the borough described the town centre as an Artists Enterprise Zone, to be achieved by repurposing unused ground floor retail spaces as affordable artists’ studios. Create helped refine the thinking and extend the project’s ambition, proposing a new model of socially responsible tenancy that can support cultural participation."

The formwork was made using standard reusable parts and left unlined, reducing waste on site. Exposed ceilings provide thermal mass to reduce overheating, while covered walkways reduce solar gain at the hottest time of day. Dual aspect openings allow natural cross-ventilation, and hot water is provided through a communal Air Source Heat Pump. The building has over 20% less embodied carbon than the RIBA 2030 climate challenge target and GLA aspirational target."
