                "The site's position brought planning complexity with it, and the form needed to respond to the constraints of a subservient rear garden that is also prominent corner plot.",
                "The low energy house will be net zero once complete with two PV panels,  has an exposed engineered timber structure and is supported by sustainable technologies (including an exhaust air heat pump) to provide a comfortable and resilient internal environment.",
