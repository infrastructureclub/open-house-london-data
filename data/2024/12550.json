                "Once inside, Lukas will delve into the key design approaches to redevelop the building, turning an unremarkable three-story masonry structure into a high-quality, flexible workspace. He will highlight how the design leverages the buildingâ€™s existing spatial and material qualities, retaining the original masonry-clad steel frame and seamlessly integrating a new lightweight three-story extension. This extension, crafted from hot-dipped galvanised steel, adds a distinctive yet harmonious addition to the existing silver-grey brick base."
