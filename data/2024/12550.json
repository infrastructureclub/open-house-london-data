The new facades are made with hot-dipped galvanised steel plates, designed to be harmonious with the existing silver-grey brick base.",
                "Architectural elements such as eaves, window sills, and reveals are deliberately emphasised to balance the building’s mass and provide passive solar shading for the large ribbon windows. The project’s focus on reusing the existing structure has significantly reduced carbon emissions during construction, while passive design details will contribute to lower energy consumption during operation, making this project an exemplar of environmental sustainability."
