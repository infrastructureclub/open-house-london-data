The three storeys above the ground floor served as accommodation for the officers and their families.",
                "The Old Fire Station ceased to be operational in 1916 due to it being too small for the motorised fire engines which were then being introduced. It subsequently became the church hall for the neighbouring parish church of St Luke and retained this function until the 1960s. During this period, in 1927, the ground floor of the building was extended to cover what had been the rear courtyard and stables.",
                "By 1967, the building became home to two local amateur drama groups who had combined to seek a permanent venue. The design for the conversion of the building to a theatre was by Owen Luder (later to become President of the Royal Institute of British Architects on two occasions). The area behind the distinctive red doors, where the appliances and horses had originally been kept, became the stage of the 100 seater Bell Theatre. An additional studio space with flexible seating, was added in 1976, the same year that the original parts of the building gained Grade II listed status."

A grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund was approved in July 2014 and work started in September 2016. The renovation was carried out by Thomas Ford and Partners. In the meantime, SLT moved temporarily to Stanley Halls, South Norwood and performed there from November 2015 to April 2018.",
                "Following the renovation, there is now only one (larger) performance space, but it has greater seating capacity and is fully flexible:  the seating arrangements and acting space are often changed completely depending on the needs of each play. The ceiling is higher so stage lighting is improved. There are two rehearsal rooms on the first floor and second floor accommodates our large wardrobe collection. The building is now far more accessible including a lift to all floors except the third.",
                "In 2018 the newly renovated building was renamed the Old Fire Station and the first performances took place in March, by the SLT Youth Group, and in April.  Since then, SLT has performed around 20 shows per year, with the exception of the COVID lockdown. A full list of all SLT productions is available at www.sltarchive.co.uk.",
