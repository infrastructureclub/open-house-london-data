                "Tottenham Cemetery was opened in 1858 under the provisions of the Metropolitan Interments Act (1850), a response to the acute shortage of space in Londonâ€™s churchyards and burial grounds. The Act enabled the construction of new cemeteries by publicly financed burial boards run by parish vestries. Tottenham & Wood Green Burial Board was formed in 1854 with offices at No. 586 High Road. The parish churchyard of All Hallows closed for burials in 1857.The Board purchased 5 acres (2 ha.) of agricultural land in 1858, of which the western three acres were consecrated for Anglican burials in December 1857, while the remaining two acres on the east side were reserved for nonconformist burials. The layout of the first generation of Victorian cemeteries was influenced by the work of John Claudius Loudon, whose treatise in 1843 established the grid system of laying out and planting."
