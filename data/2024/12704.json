Visitors can not only view pieces from the UK’s finest studio glass artists, but can also watch them practise their craft in the studio that lies beyond its white walls. To the beat of a searing furnace, they coax molten glass, transforming the shapes of their imagination into solid form. It seems almost impossible that these glowing orbs can be related to the cool polished objects displayed in the adjoining gallery.",
