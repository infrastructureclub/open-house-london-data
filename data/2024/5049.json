                "Built in 1872 to supply water to the rapidly growing steam network at St Pancras, the Waterpoint is an extremely significant building.\n \nIt was designed by the office of George Gilbert Scott, the architect responsible for the magnificent Midland Grand Hotel. The ornate brickwork and elaborate detailing is an indication of the importance of engineering to the Victorians.\n \nAt around 9m x 6m and 3 stories high, it is an impressive presence. The top floor contains a vast 2,400 cubic foot capacity cast iron water tank which supplied the increasing number of steam engines flowing in and out of the station.\n \nIn 2001, the development of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Terminus meant the Waterpoint was threatened with demolition. As the building was of such architectural and engineering importance, English Heritage intervened and an agreement was reached with London and Continental Rail to find a way to move it instead. A new site was found 700 meters to the north east and the journey began.\n \nThe Waterpoint does not have disabled access as it has a number of stairs and uneven surfaces to contend with, in addition to a spiral staircase."
