It’s here that the group decided that they were hungry – not for more sandwiches, but to do things differently. They wanted to break free from the shackles of traditional agencies and be 100% independent. To be free to do the best work possible.",
                "Since its beginnings Mother, had all of their staff work around a table. As the company grew, the table grew. Today, Mother is still fiercely independent, but now there are over 500 like-minded people in our family, with offices across London, New York, Los Angeles, Shanghai and Berlin. All with kitchen tables in them. And all with people sitting around them that come to work every day to make the best work they possibly can. Come on in. Everybody who is passionate about great work is always welcome at our table."

                "Our new Home, originally the Lipton Tea Warehouse, was a state-of-the art bacon curing plant — built on the site of a tea storage facility, hence the name. The bacon factory, and an adjoining warehouse for teapacking (known today as the Biscuit Building — home to Shoreditch House and Mother), were owned by the Lipton grocery brand, which distributed tea around the world and bacon across London.",
                "Mother took 42,000 sqft of the eastern portion of the Biscuit Building. As there was no direct connection from the newly created entrance (an old loading dock), Clive Wilkinson Architects proposed driving a large 14-foot wide staircase through the building from ground to loading level to first floor and then second floor.",
                "The 4.2-meter-wide staircase turns into the Agency’s concrete worktable and circuits through the upper floor like a racetrack, becoming perhaps the world’s largest table at 250 feet long.",
                "To mitigate sound in the hard factory space, the Design Team designed 2.1-meter-long lamp shades padded with 75mm of acoustic foam. The 50 light fixtures were then covered with unique patterns of Marimekko fabric selected from archive stock in its’ factory in Helsinki, achieving the effect of a large art installation.",
                "The inspiration for the concrete table was inspired by the iconic 1920’s Giacomo Matte-Trucco rooftop race track for Fiat Lingotto in Turin—making a monumental statement.",
                "Our Ground floor area was refreshed by Interior Architects Holloway Li at the start of 2024."
