                "As an urban food sustainability hub and pursuing ambitions to contribute to London being a market garden city, Wolves Lane offers a blend of new, soon-to-open cutting-edge sustainable buildings designed by Studio Gil and Material Cultures, alongside our historic glasshouse structures from the 1970s.",
                "Originally run by Haringey Council as a plant nursery, producing various plants for the borough, and including an impressive Palm House and Cacti House,  since May 2019 it has been led and managed by Wolves Lane Consortium - the co-stewards of which are Organic Lea and The Ubele Initiative CIC",
                "The Wolves Lane Consortium has a shared vision to create new and expanded opportunities for local communities to engage in sustainable food growing, food distribution, healthy eating and cooking, and nature connection through volunteering, training, employment, and enterprise.  Also, and in partnership with London's GLA and Haringey Council, and with the support of the National Lottery, Oak Foundation and the Clothworkers Foundation, the goal is to contribute to making London a market garden city.",
                "The Centre is proud to host and to support the growth of Black Rootz, the UK's first multigenerational Black-led growing initiative. This initiative fosters knowledge exchange between seasoned growers and younger generations, nurturing a vital connection to our natural surroundings and providing much-needed respite within an urban setting.",
                "We invite visitors and community members to join us for an engaging and unique Open House event.",
                "Explore the innovative design and construction techniques, including structural methods like straw bale construction, sustainable drainage, and rainwater harvesting.",
                "Visitors can also tour our glasshouses to learn about the diverse plants we grow on site and how we promote food sovereignty within Haringey and contribute to London becoming a market garden city.",
                "Wolves Lane is a centre for knowledge and skill sharing, where young and old interact, building vital connections with nature. Our community thrives on participation from volunteers and growers, fostering horticultural awareness and learning for all.",
                "Join us and discover the vibrancy of Wolves Lane, where history, innovation, and community come together to create a sustainable and inclusive urban oasis.",
