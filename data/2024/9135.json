Of all the buildings in the Lansbury Exhibition, the Susan Lawrence School was the most admired at the time. 'It seems to have passed its searching test with dazzling success', wrote Building in July 1951, 'It has urbanity, it has an elegant unity of planning, it is something new in London's East End.'",
