                "This project offers a new, innovative model for densification of inner-city sites and a sustainable way of addressing the current shortfalls in funding for new public facilities. Overall, the project delivers 175 residential units and commercial/gallery space which cross fund the building of a school as well as other public benefits. The scheme also makes an outstanding contribution to the local neighbourhood through creation of a new public space for Londoners with improved connectivity and permeability.",
                "The site strategy adopts a layered approach to the overall massing, composed of low-, mid- and high-rise development. This allows the development to be tailored to the unique conditions on each boundary and mitigates impacts to neighbouring residential and commercial properties.",
