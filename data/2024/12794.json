                "The walk explores the decline of the area in the 1980’s - contrasting the then high incidence of crime, drugs and prostitution with the impressive regeneration over the past two decades. We will focus on the spectacular renovation of key places such as Coal Drops Yard and the emergence of new commercial outlets, businesses and luxury flats. We’ll take in the recent repurposing of buildings such as the brutalist Standard Hotel, former annexe of Camden Council, and the Scala nightclub.",
                "The walk also focuses on areas such as Pentonville Prison and the Hillview Housing Estate where we’ll contemplate how older public institutions and social housing sit with more recent gentrification of the area. Community, health and education provision, such as the radically designed Hugh Cubitt Centre and the British Library, will be considered.",
                "We will take a few moments to reflect on the tragedy of the 1980’s Kings Cross fire and how safety standards in public transport and services improved in the aftermath.",
