                "Visit Albert Square on Sunday 15th of September to explore a playful renovation and extension by Dominic McKenzie Architects.",
                "The house, which is Grade-II listed, forms part of a characterful Victorian square in South London. Dominic McKenzie Architects have worked with the clients to renovate the interior of the existing house, as well as adding an extension in the rear garden.",
                "A key detail of the extension is its bespoke brickwork fa√ßade, which features custom arched bricks designed by DMA. The design combines the repeating contemporary motif of these bricks with a traditional Flemish bond that references the construction of the original house. The geometric playfulness of this design language is also found in a number of arches and circles elsewhere in the house.",
                "Inside, a core design concept is the use of bespoke douglas fir joinery throughout the kitchen and living space in the lower ground floor of the house. This is a reference to Gothenburg City Hall by the renowned 20th-Century Swedish architect Gunnar Asplund. The original floorplan, which was highly compartmentalised, has been opened up in order to create larger, more generous living spaces for the clients."
