Soho’s narrow streets have been blighted by cholera and seen some of the country’s first specialist hospitals. Many of its buildings escaped the bombing of WWll and at least in part can be seen today.",

                "In Henry Vlll's time in the 1500s Soho was all green fields- it was his royal park for hunting. \nIt was only developed after the fire of London in 1666 destroyed most of the City.  Built initially for the rich it soon became home to those in Europe fleeing persecution and poverty. \nBy the 1800s there were 327 inhabitants per acre making it one of the most densely populated areas in London.\nThere was poverty, ill health and one in five women worked in the sex industry. \nCome and see the sites of some of Soho's nameless and most desperate people of the 1700s and 1800s. \nOn this walking tour we find the doorways with stories behind them.\nWe cover just over a mile of Soho, from a workhouse, to a picnic spot beneath which lies a secret, to the first anatomy school in London, to the pump whose water killed 500 people in two weeks before taking in a 'magical brothel', the stories of prominent \"devotees of venus\" and visiting the sites of  the first speciality hospitals in London that cared for women, children and those with the 'foul' disease. \nWe start at @sohoplace theatre at 4, Soho Place, Charing Cross Road, London W1D, 3BG. \nThere will be some sexual content (historical and tasteful) and some gore. It will be funny and moving  - sometimes at the same time."
