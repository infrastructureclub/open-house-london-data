Soho’s narrow streets have been blighted by cholera and seen some of the country’s first specialist hospitals. Many of its buildings escaped the bombing of WWll and at least in part can be seen today.",

Built initially for the rich, it soon became home to those from Europe fleeing persecution and poverty. \nBy the 1800s there were 327 inhabitants per acre making it one of the most densely populated areas in London.\nThere was poverty, ill health and one in five women worked in the sex industry. \nCome and see the sites of some of Soho's nameless and most desperate people of the 1700s and 1800s.",
                "On this walking tour we find the doorways with stories behind them.\nWe cover just over a mile of Soho, from a workhouse, to a picnic spot beneath which lies a secret, to the first anatomy school in London, to the pump whose water killed 500 people in two weeks, before taking in a 'magical brothel', the stories of prominent \"devotees of Venus\" and visiting the sites of  the first speciality hospitals in London that cared for women, children and those with the 'foul' disease.",
