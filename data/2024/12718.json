                "Armstrong Audio is a leading specialist with 40 years' experience in home, high-end and professional audio equipment repairs.",
                "Established in 1932 the company was originally called 'Armstrong Wireless & Television Ltd.'. Based in Camden, London, the company began by manufacturing public address systems, radios and televisions for public use in WWII. The advent of the home high fidelity market in the 1950s saw the company successfully diversify and manufacture \"The High Fidelity Sound\" range of home radios, amplifiers and receivers through to the late 1970s. Combining good performance and stylish looks, the 600 Series amplifier attracted an avid fan base with members still bringing them back for a service to this day.",
                "The 1980s saw consumers shift towards the growing overseas audio market. This led the company to move away from manufacturing and into the service and repair side of the industry. From here and relocating to Walthamstow, London, Armstrong Audio developed its reputation as a leading audio repair specialist with unrivalled knowledge and expertise."
