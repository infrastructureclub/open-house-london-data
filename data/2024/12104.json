                "This exhibition showcases the work of Artist and Landscape Designer Dan Lee. Dan is a self taught painter who studied architecture and practiced as a gardener before founding his Landscape Design studio Studio Topo. This is his first London solo show of paintings and drawings hosted by Nicola Read at Host of Leyton. Nicola taught Dan in his final year of design studio at the London School of Architecture many years ago. The paintings on show explore a wide range of landscapes with varying atmospheres of land, sky and weather. They are colourful, joyous and abstract. Dan wants the work to \"be an excuse for people to look at depictions of nature and the British countryside and feel positive and want to engage and explore these environments. The works evoke places you may know or places you'd like to go.\" Dan feels as though parts of our rural landscape will need to take on different roles in the future. What will our dependency on different rural zones look like in the future? How do these landscapes adjust to our needs for equity, access to land, food, energy, leisure and health?",

In order to move towards an inclusive and productive language, we need to interrogate the way we currently describe our built environment. Imagining new dialects of change has the potential to enable more public engagement with the built environment.",
