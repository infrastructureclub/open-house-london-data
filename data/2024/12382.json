                "Woodside Loft is a residential loft conversion to what was originally a modest 1930s three-bed semi.\nThis is a unique loft-space.  It takes advantage of the views to the front of the building and a previous extension’s small, pitched roof. It’s an expansive, multi-use space, with a modern-retro style. The space is bright, spacious, organic, and comfortable. It acts as a living room with a view, a guest room, a project space, a place to relax, a place to be alone, and a place to be together with family or friends."

                "The view from the front of the house is more appealing than the view from the back, so the widest possible combination of Velux Cabrio windows was utilised on the frontal aspect.  These also open up to create a balcony at the front of the house, which can then be folded away (all within the rules of Permitted Development). An additional benefit to their particular placement was headroom for full-height access to the toilet/shower-room entrance.",
                "The wide dormer structure to the rear was given an artificial (left) side, such that the shape of the pitched-roof is maintained on both front and back – allowing for a powerful triangular form to meet the eye upon entering the room (and giving opportunity for deep storage compartments along the party wall).",
                "The party wall was heavily sound-proofed.  Cork bark panels hide supporting steels, whilst providing the backdrop for a “jungle” feature – highlighted by LED strips and spotlights.",
                "Mirrors are installed in the deepest recesses for the illusion of additional space.",
                "The artificial dormer side houses a unique bar/kitchenette area – which includes sink, fridge/freezer, and microwave.",
                "Rear-facing, is a 4.5m-wide two-pane sliding window (from a low-cost patio-door supplier). This makes a powerful statement, but also creates a large opening for furniture access.  Framing the window is a large window-seat, (created from six kitchen worktops,) generating additional storage. (accessible via two ultra-wide hinged-doors (supported by rollers) – for maximum storage flexibility, but minimal visual interruption.)",
                "Two pocket-doors close off the “cave” area. This space is all about relaxing on the floor – for reading, rolling around, watching TV, or even sleep-overs.  It has thick carpet with additional foam padding.  Curved plastering and rag-rolled paintwork hides unsightly hip rafters and creates an inviting, practical space out of an area that would have otherwise been unliveable.",
                "The landing/washroom area is clad in oak battens.  (Offcuts were used to border the “jungle” planters.)  The hard corner was softened to a 45-degree angle.  The intention was to create a monolithic, yet warm entity to sit within the main loft-space to act as a feature in its own right. The area above this structure was left open for its spatial contribution. A (low-cost 1280BTU) radiator provides heat for the main space and an internal double-glazed window (with encased RGB LED lighting) allows natural light into the stairwell.",
                "A large table and bench were also created from kitchen worktops. With the addition of two side-panels (otherwise housed under the window-seat), the table converts to a full-size table-tennis table.",
                "With the exception of the Velux windows, low-cost solutions were adopted almost everywhere – but with no compromise in the final deliverable – resulting in a space that we’re very happy with and proud of."
