                "For at least 900 years a church dedicated to St Margaret of Antioch has stood on this site. At least three versions of the church were built; the previous one was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666. Wren designed the present church which was built between 1684 and 1687. Two lead rain-water heads on the outside north wall have the date 1685. The neighbouring parish of St Gabriel Fen, whose church had also been destroyed in the Fire, was then united with St Margaret’s. \nSt Margaret’s tower and spire were built and finished by means of money provided by a new tax on coal entering the Port of London. The 200 foot spire is the only remaining example of Wren’s lead-covered timber spires, . The tower holds two refurbished bells, one of which dates from before the Great Fire of  London. \nThe church is an example of pared back simplicity, built under the Stuarts but anticipating the Georgian era of large clear windows allowing light to flood in. Built of stone but with an interior wrapped in oak, it became the Guild church of the Pattenmakers (founded 1379) and the Basketmakers (1569) in 1954 and its walls record the Master Pattenmakers from 1670, and the Basketmaker Prime Wardens from 1922"
