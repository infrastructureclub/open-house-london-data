                "North Lambeth was historically low lying, marshy and liable to flooding, making it unsuitable for extensive building. However,  parts of the Medieval complex at Lambeth Palace and St Mary's, the parish Church of Lambeth, survive.",
                "The area changed with the coming of the railway. The tracks had to be elevated over the swampy ground by the construction of a series of viaducts and arches. The new Station, completed in 1848, took its name from the Waterloo Bridge that connects to the north bank, and a short time later the use of ' Waterloo' as a district of London came into being.",
                "In the wake of the station's construction, churches, houses and places of entertainment were lost. However, in the 20th and 21st centuries these spaces were reborn and revealed again by a change of use and new purposes.",
                "The South Bank area also has a history of health care and hospitals and while ground-breaking 21st Century Life Sciences develop in Waterloo, former hospitals await discovery along the route.",
                "Now one of Londonâ€™s best-loved destinations, the South Bank riverside attracts visitors seeking culture and leisure attractions. Where only a few decades ago breweries, power stations and timber wharves operated, today stand some of the UK's most iconic cultural institutions the likes of National Theatre and the Southbank Centre.",
                "On this walk, we will reveal how South Bank's unique mix of buildings tell stories of South Bank's - and indeed of London's - past and present, and that also present visions for London's ambitions for the next century."

                "During the tours we will be looking at landmark buildings from a range of eras including the medieval, Edwardian, Victorian, Modernist and 21st Contemporary. We will be going inside some of these buildings to explore some of the interior details that are not always accessible to the public and to see how these historic spaces have been repurposed.",
                "The first tour focuses on the areas of South Bank that are part of Lambeth including landmarks such as: \n- Garden Museum \n- Lambeth Palace Library\n- St Thomas Hospital complex\n- County Hall",
                "The second tour focuses on the areas of South Bank that are part of Southwark including iconic landmarks such as:\n- Sea Containers \n- OXO Tower\n- National Theatre\n- Southbank Centre\n- Topolski's Studio",
                "At the end of each tour we will be finishing with a visit to hear about the artists and makers who still call South Bank home. \nAt County Hall we will take in a brand new artist-led contemporary ceramics gallery studio located deep inside this labyrinthine building.\nOur second tour ends at Topolski's studio, an historic artist studio beneath Hungerford Bridge where visitors will hear from Topolski's studio archivist and view some special works from the artists's vast archives."
