                "North Lambeth was historically low-lying, marshy and liable to flooding, making it unsuitable for extensive building. The area changed with the coming of the railways and the opening of the new Waterloo station in 1848. The tracks had to be elevated over the swampy ground by the construction of a series of viaducts and arches.",
                "In the wake of the station's construction, churches, houses and places of entertainment were lost. However, in the 20th and 21st centuries, these spaces were reborn and revealed again by a change of use and new purposes.",
                "Now one of London’s best-loved destinations, the South Bank riverside attracts visitors seeking culture and leisure attractions. Where only a few decades ago breweries, power stations and timber wharves operated, today stand some of the UK's most iconic cultural institutions, the likes of National Theatre and the Southbank Centre.",
                "On this walk, we will reveal how South Bank's unique mix of buildings tell stories of South Bank's - and indeed of London's - past and present, and that also present visions for London's ambitions for the next century."
