                "Bridging the area’s long history, the project delves into its interwoven industrial and residential heritage, centring on chimneys as the ever-changing but constant indicator of this narrative. Despite technological advances rendering them functionally redundant, chimneys still define our collective silhouette of the city and are a staple in any child’s drawings of a house. They hold an inescapable and romantic position linking us to our personal and collective pasts."
