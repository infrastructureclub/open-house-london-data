                "Brigitte Beraha is a composer, vocalist and lyricist who has written a piece of music for 4 a cappella female voices. They will specifically make use of the acoustics of this church through this new body of work as a direct response to the occasion and also to the building itself, its natural acoustics and surrounding reverb. Through the music the musicians will express the dichotomy between the exterior façade of the Church - which sits quietly amongst the outside noise of the streets -  and the inside of the building, where one might find beauty in the moment, and a moment of calm and solace within the acoustic space that they are in.",
