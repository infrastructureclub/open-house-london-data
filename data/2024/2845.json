                "The site upon which the Charterhouse (formally known as Sutton’s Hospital in Charterhouse) stands was acquired in the middle of the fourteenth century as a burial ground for the victims of the Black Death. In 1371 Sir Walter Manny, one of Edward III's senior advisers founded a Carthusian Monastery. A prior and twenty-four monks were accommodated in two-storey houses arranged around a characteristically large cloister, and the church built alongside the Burial Ground became the priory church.",
                "In 1535, the monks refused to align themselves with Henry VIII’s Act of Supremacy and some were executed at Tyburn in a most brutal way. The monastery was suppressed and passed to the crown. Subsequently it was granted to Lord North, who constructed a fine Tudor mansion which was later sold to the fourth Duke of Norfolk, who further embellished it.",
                "In 1611 Norfolk’s son, Thomas Howard, first Earl of Suffolk, sold the mansion to Thomas Sutton, building Audley End in Essex with the proceeds. Sutton was said to be the wealthiest commoner in England. He had held the post of Master of the Ordnance in the Northern Parts from 1568 to 1594 and his involvement in the coal trade, advantageous property dealings and money lending had allowed him to amass a considerable fortune. He used much of his wealth to endow a charitable foundation to educate boys and care for elderly gentlemen. The school developed to such an extent that in 1872 it moved to a new site in Godalming, near Guildford, Surrey, where it remains to this day.",
                "The Charterhouse sustained much damage during the Second World War but was faithfully restored by the architects Seely and Paget.",
