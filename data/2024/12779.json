Our significant commissions there for Imperial College and the BBC have been a part of the neighbourhood's transformation as it has moved from playing a secondary role in logistics and services to becoming a melting pot of technology, media and education. Whilst much of this transformation has focused on new development, the 6.8 ha of White City Place tell a story of adaptive reuse, an urban environment that is being reshaped to attractive collaborative, entrepreneurial and innovative activity."

                "Renowned in the fields of science, engineering, medicine and business, Imperial College London has been developing a new innovation district in west London, 5km west from its historic Victorian home in South Kensington. The decision to expand has been one of the most important in its history. One reason is practical; it simply cannot grow anymore in its compact South Kensington campus, but perhaps more importantly, a new campus at White City is enabling essential change. For Imperial, the future scientific, technological, and medical research will be multi-disciplinary and collaborative. And so White City proposes a new sort of place, vibrant and open, igniting discovery and innovation with researchers, academics and business forging new and creative links in a place of shared endeavour."
