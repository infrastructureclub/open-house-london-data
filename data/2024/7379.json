Inspired by the curved shapes of string instruments, the 309-seat cherry-lined Susie Sainsbury Theatre has been acoustically refined to deliver excellent sound qualities. Within the boundary walls, the Theatre incorporates 40% more seating than previously through the addition of a balcony, a larger orchestra pit, stage wing and fly tower. All seats offer excellent sightlines to the stage, while the larger orchestra pit expands repertoire choice from early to modern opera and musical theatre. The lighting deconstructs the traditional chandelier into an exploding theatre-wide galaxy of light through 600 fibre-optic crystals."

Entirely lined in pale, lime-washed oak, an oculus floods the room with daylight and provides the space with a central focus.
