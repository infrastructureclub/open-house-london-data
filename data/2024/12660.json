[…] The whole area was poked with inexplicable holes and drifts of exotic litter. And most thrillingly to me it was being overwhelmed by a forest of disreputable plants.”",
                "In the footsteps of Maybe, the tour looks at the botany of Harmondsworth Moor 60 years on asking: What has become of the 'disreputable plants', meaning weeds, he found? What do we  know about them and what can they tell us about cohabiting with the natural world?"
