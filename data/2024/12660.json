                "The flora of Harmondsworth Moor was brought under the public gaze by amateur botanist Richard Mabey when in the early 1970s he wrote:",
                "“This was the Middlesex borderlands, a huge area of wasteland being slowly overtaken by hi-tech industry… […] … To the west [of my office] lay a labyrinth of gravel pits, now flooded, and refuse tips whose ancestry went back to Victorian times. […] The whole area was poked with inexplicable holes and drifts of exotic litter. And most thrillingly to me it was being overwhelmed by a forest of disreputable plants.” (Mabey, 2012, pp. 1–2)",
                "This walking tour, led by artist Nick Ferguson and ranger and naturalist Rebecca Harris, looks at the botany of Harmondsworth Moor 50 years on. We’ll identify flora and explore their representation in folklore, magic, medicine, cooking and craft, and ongoing importance for science today. We'll ask: What do we know about the 'disreputable plants' Mabey found?  How has the expansion of hi-tech industry (Heathrow Airport lies immediately to the south and east) affected them ? And, what can they tell us about botanical biodiversity in a global city ? The distance of the walk is estimated to be around 4 km and it will last around 1 hour 30 minutes."
