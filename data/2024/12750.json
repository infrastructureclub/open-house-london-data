They combine social work values with interior design skills to create trauma-informed, fully furnished healing homes for women and children escaping domestic abuse, who are placed in empty social housing or living with furniture poverty and who have experienced multiple disadvantages and trauma. They do this by saving good quality furniture from landfill and partnering with the interiors industry to design, fully furnish and decorate families' homes."
