Clare Market and Drury Lane were a tangle of disreputable alleys until the new streets cut them in half. But traces remain, and this walk dives into the back streets to track the vanished lanes and recreate their past at the core of ancient London.\nEn route learn about two of SAVE Britain's Heritage cases: the Strand Piazza and 152-158 Strand. We campaigned vigorously against the proposed demolition of 152-158 Strand to preserve and enhance the historic setting of Somerset House and the Baroque gem of St Mary-le-Strand. The tour will end with a visit to St Clement Danes Church before returning to Temple Tube station."
