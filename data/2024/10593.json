                "Entry to 1 Quality Court is via a narrow covered alley with Victorian tiles and is now built over by a modern building with Tudor accents in the stonework and windows. \nThe arched passage is also decorated with iron work that proclaims the name of the alley and the passageway is lined with red and white tiles. If you look down and to your right as you enter, there is a large boot scraper built into the wall. \nThe court was built up around 1700 as the area developed with new buildings along Chancery Lane and it was first named on maps by the time of the Rocque map of 1749. The Rocque map was a Georgian map of the entirety of London to create a detailed and accurate representation of 18th Century London, surveyed by John Rocque. The court is paved in stone and enhanced by square cast iron planters. \n1 Quality Court was originally the Patent Office before it moved away and you can still see an old sign telling people that the Patent Office has now closed. The Patent Office, now called the “Intellectual Property Office”, deals and has dealt with property policy, educating businesses on this, supporting intellectual property enforcement and granting trademarks as well as design rights."
