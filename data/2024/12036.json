                "Sugar House Island has a rich industrial heritage which is evidenced today throughout the development. Reclaimed Victorian era warehouses have been retrofit for modern uses including Jim & Tonic’s gin distillery, bar and restaurant, The Talent House’s dance and recording studios and contemporary apartments in The Sugar House. Two industrial era chimneys were carefully dismantled when construction began, taken away for cleaning and have now been rebuilt in their original footprint using the same bricks. Subtle nods to the site's history can be found throughout, from the materials and colour pallets of new buildings, to the naming of streets and yards. The industries that have operated here throughout history include textile and ink manufacturing, sugar refinery, soap makers and Gin distillery."

As a London based company that proudly embraces its Urban Spirit, it needed a location that offered the space, infrastructure, and opportunity for them to develop new, innovative, and sustainable solutions to Spirit Production.\nFor Jim & Tonic, a sustainable approach is not just about the environment, emissions, and resources, but about building a community - giving back, and forming part of the everyday lives of our neighbours - in a way that benefits everyone.  Reuse, reduce, recycle has always been one of their mottos, and for that reason a lot of the decor, furniture and construction materials have been upcycled. \nJoin Jim & Tonic for tours of the gin distillery and guided tasting sessions, as well as music, fun and festivities throughout the day."
