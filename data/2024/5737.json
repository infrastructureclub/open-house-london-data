                "This four-bedroom private house sits in the Kew Gardens Conservation Area. A crisp weathering steel volume of two corten shells is inserted behind the retained walls of a 19th century brick stables. The weathering steel shells will create a patina and colour responsive to the local vernacular, and are delicately perforated to cast dappled light in the interior spaces, reminiscent of light filtered through trees.",
                "The house is divided into two distinct wings. The larger wing, housing day to day communal areas, is created by the steel insertion behind the retained stables gable end. The smaller wing, containing more private spaces and master bedroom, is clad fully in weathered steel and glass and is set back from the street. The two wings are connected by a transparent, glazed circulation link, which overlooks a secluded outdoor courtyard; a seamless and secure extension of the internal space.",
                "The pitched forms of the corten shells pick up the rhythms of the rooflines of the Kew Gardens Conservation Area, the adjacent church roof and the retained stable gable end."

                "- The corten steel shells were fabricated by specialist fabricators CSI in Hull, transported to London and craned into place on site.\n- The interior carpentry and joiner has been fabricated on site in a basement workshop, using a CNC (computer numerical control) machine. \n- The orientation of the building reduces peak solar gain, while ensuring optimum levels of daylight both morning and evening. The house is designed such that mechanical cooling is not required. \n- Gross floor area: 375 sqm\n- Architects: Piercy & Company is an award winning architectural practice with a reputation for bold ideas, strong forms and carefully crafted buildings. Led by Stuart Piercy, the studio interprets vernacular architecture and traditional forms, preserving links to the past whilst addressing the conditions of contemporary cities and technologies.  \n- Structural Engineer: Tim Lucas, Price & Myers"
