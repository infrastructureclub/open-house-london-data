                "195 Mare Street was built in 1697 for Abraham Dolins, a wealthy merchant from Holland. The house was a grand country retreat from the City of London. Art by famous European artists, including Rembrandt and van Dyck, was displayed in the house. Generations of the Dolins family lived in the house until 1800. It was later owned by Thomas Wilson, the Tory MP for the City of London, who was a supporter of the slave trade and argued for reparations for slave owners. In 1860, the house was sold to the Elizabeth Fry Society and became the Elizabeth Fry Refuge for women prisoners. Thousands of women and girls lived in the house after serving short prison sentences. In the twentieth century, the house became the New Lansdowne Working Men's Club and an important part of Hackney's social life. The Club closed in 2004 and the house was abandoned for years before being repaired by a local developer and sold to the current owners, who will restore it to a family home and community arts space."
