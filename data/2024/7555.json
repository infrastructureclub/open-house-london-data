Today, this important collection is used to facilitate teaching, research and public engagement in human health and disease, both at the museum and across University College London.\nMany of our specimens, the majority of which are preserved in fluid, demonstrate common historic diseases like rickets and tuberculosis. Alongside these, the museum contains examples of skeletal material, foreign bodies (things that have been swallowed, inhaled, or inserted), wax models, plaster casts and microscope slides.",
