The House boasts several original Adams features, including the cornice in the Great Room, iconic Adam stairwells, 14 Adam fireplaces and extensive vaults. The Great Room showcases James Barry’s series of paintings started in 1777 and completed in 1801, alongside portraits painted by Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds.",
