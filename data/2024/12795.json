                "Bloomsbury to most visitors means leafy squares and graceful Georgian terraces, studded with tourist attractions like the British Museum and Senate House. But there is another side to the area – and that’s what this walk will explore. Beyond the elegant grid of streets and squares that belong to the Bedford Estates, Bloomsbury has been developed by a patchwork of landowners and builders over the past three-and-a-half centuries, and this is a walk through the more varied streetscape that has resulted.",
                "Starting inside the 1740s Grade II listed Pushkin House on the southern edge, we'll wander through the back streets and alleys of the often overlooked eastern side of Bloomsbury, looking at efforts in the past and present to rebuild, reuse and reinvent buildings at the edges of a conservation area and taking in architectural gems, hidden gardens, Russian revolutionaries and historic social housing developments.",
