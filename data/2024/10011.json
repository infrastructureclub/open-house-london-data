Completed in 1913 it comprises 15 five-storey buildings providing 462 homes, and is one of the earliest examples of purpose-built social housing in the UK."

This includes a mix of one, two, three and four-bedroom flats specifically designed to match the needs of local residents. In the process, Clarion has made the homes larger, more energy efficient  and lighter for families to enjoy.",
                "Residents in the remaining 303 homes have benefitted from an extensive programme of upgrades including new kitchens and bathrooms, as well as improvements to communal areas, door entry systems and lifts. \nAn integrated play trail will weave through the estate, and areas between buildings will become people-friendly shared spaces with 23 new trees and attractive planting, as well as improved bin and bike storage.  A horticultural apprenticeship has been created to look after these new green spaces."
