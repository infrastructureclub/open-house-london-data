If 'YES!' then join us as we saunter around Temple / the Strand with these questions in mind, stopping to peek at parts of the city fabric that we often overlook - learning about the designers and deciders.",

This tour weaves together the conception of the public realm from the 19th century to the present day and invites the group to engage with elements of the fabric of London that help the city and its inhabitants live and breathe.",
                "We will pause to evaluate historical and recent attempts to make the city a usable and enjoyable space, and consider the degree of success these efforts have had through objects we find on our way - from the iconic telephone boxes to some more unexpected objects of interest.",
