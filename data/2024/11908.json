St Andrew's many attractions include its breathtaking stained glass, mostly by the renowned Martin Travers, in the Lady Chapel, the Chancel and the \"kaleidoscopic\" Great East Window, its marble flooring in the Sanctuary, its ornate ironwork, its rich wood carvings, its Assyrian gargoyles projecting from the Lady Chapel buttresses and its Alfred Hunter and Sons organ.",

Contemplate the beauty of its sacred interior under your own steam or join a small tour to discover more before enjoying a drink and a cake in our pop-up café in the Church Hall."
