                "Holy Trinity Church was built in 1827—1829 to the designs of Sir Charles Barry, a young architect at the time, who later went on to design the Houses of Parliament and to achieve international renown.",
                "At the time it cost £11,899 to build, amongst considerable anxiety, and the budget over-ran by £899.",
                "The building was designed in the Tudor Gothic style with stock brick, bath stone dressings and a slate roof and is said to be inspired by King’s College, Cambridge. There are a number of stained-glass windows still in situ, but the finest is the five-light east window designed by the renowned Thomas Willement (1786—1871), depicting Sir Richard Cloudesley, the benefactor of the Cloudesley Charity which gave the land.",

                "The Florence Trust was founded as an educational charity by painter Patrick Hamilton and opened its doors to artists in 1990 with support from English Heritage and the Council for the Care of Churches.\n \nHamilton had worked in a large communal studio in Florence, Italy and was inspired to replicate the beautiful surroundings and atmosphere of exchange that he had found so productive, in London.\n \nAt the Florence Trust he created a place where exchange with other artists is productively encouraged and where the surroundings themselves add beauty and inspiration.\n \nThe Florence Trust was located at St Saviours, Highbury, a unique, Grade-1 listed, neo-gothic, former Anglican church, considered one of the best examples of the work of eccentric architect William White (1825-1900).\n \nIn 2023 The Florence Trust moved to its new home at Holy Trinity, to re-establish the residency program and carry on its work in supporting artists.",
