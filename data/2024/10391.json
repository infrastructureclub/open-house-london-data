                "C3 is the heart of the Design District forming half of Bureau, an entry level coworking club which offers a range of studio and social spaces with flexible, low cost membership designed specifically for those in the creative industries. The building provides approximately 1,300 sqm of new work and gathering spaces with a ground floor restaurant, screening lounge and external recessed courtyards.\n \nIts clean, white aesthetic is interrupted by the informality of its skin, shaping unexpected ways to enjoy interstitial spaces and soften boundaries. The undulating plan shapes the angle and depth of view from the irregular, oversized apertures onto the narrow lanes and the public squares. Vertical, white, curved extrusions wrap the exterior of the building. The irregular oscillation works to break down the building mass from the outside and create informal pools of owned space within the open floor plan. Windows in the façade line face different directions, like bay windows, allowing both views into the narrow lanes from within the building and vice versa. As the building has such an animated skin, the shadow play of the tracking sun creates ever changing elevations and very different qualities of space at the building edges. Despite the unusual nature of the façade it has been highly regulated in order to ensure that the construction stays sustainable and low cost, allowing the creative spaces within to stay affordable."
