Situated at the corner of the Green with distant views and proximity to a Grade II listed church, the ambitious design had a complex but successful planning journey. It has become a private haven for the homeowner.  It is a contemporary home in a Victorian shell, bathed in light through out the day and kitted out with a full height lift from cellar to loft, a spa, double height glazed atrium and a roof terrace. However, the historic value of the house is retained and there are repeated nods to the local vernacular architecture of the surrounding Victorian buildings. \nOur architects will be showing you around and answering all of your questions!"
