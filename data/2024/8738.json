                "Neave Brown (1929 – 2018) started to design the terrace in 1963 to provide housing for him and four other professionals and artists who together formed a housing society which they named Pentad.  It was built on a small plot of land at the end of Winscombe Street, a cul-de-sac of nineteenth century terraced houses.",
                "The building services were designed by Max Fordham (1933 – 2022) and Anthony Hunt (1932 – 2022) was the structural engineer.",
                "As funding for the building was a loan from Camden Council it was built to the same cost standards and space limits (the 1961 Parker Morris standards) as a three storey, three bedroom, five person council house. The required parking spaces were provided on the communal forecourt.",
                "The five families moved in in 1966. Original owners included architects Patty and Michael Hopkins and Ed Jones.  A further plot of land was added later allowing more garden space for children to play. Neave Brown lived in the terrace until 2008.",
                "The terrace was listed as Grade II in 2014 for its special architectural and historic interest."

The children’s rooms are on the lower ground floor which consists of a hall, a large double bedroom divisible with sliding doors and opening on to the garden through glazed barn doors, as well as a single bedroom, a bathroom and a vestibule/utility room.",
                "The middle floor is where adults and children meet, eat and socialise. The main street entrance is at this level and leads through a generous hallway to a combined kitchen / dining room which opens on to a terrace connected to the garden by stairs. A family bathroom and cloakroom completes this floor.",
                "Connecting the three floors internally is a single post-tensioned plywood spiral stair, lit from above by a circular domed rooflight. On the lower ground floor is a secondary entrance enabling this level to be converted into separate accommodation."

                "The Winscombe Street terrace is designed to enhance community within and between households. According to Neave Brown it was conceived ‘as a community, an extended family’ enabled especially by the use of the outdoor space which was designated as communal.  As he explained: ‘the communal garden, vastly larger and more expansive than five ordinary private strips, works as an extension of each house exactly because its boundaries are explicit and it belongs to its small community, particularly that of the children and the magic world they create within it’.",
                "This intention is supported by Pentad’s ‘Rules’ a list of 18 practical points drafted by Neave and signed up to by all Pentad members and their tenants.  The Rules state their aim as being to ‘to protect and maintain the good spirit of communality of the Pentad community’ noting that Pentad’s ‘external areas (the forecourt and garden and the private terrace off the kitchen of each house) provide exceptional conditions, a rare and precious place for the children and adults who live there, perhaps unique in London. Within that shared environment the houses are designed to provide a complementary privacy. The quality of its combination of freedom, community and privacy is valuable and vulnerable’."

                "Design influences include inter-war continental modernism (Mart Stam, Le Corbusier, Atelier 5) and British modernists, for example, Amis and Howells’ 1956 terrace of six houses in Hampstead.",
                "The street frontage has a cantilevered brick upper floor punctuated with square windows with the lower storeys recessed. Each house has a concrete spiral stair in a semi-circular board marked concrete ‘drum’. This leads up to the main entrance via a tiled balcony enclosed by a timber and wire mesh balustrade. Below is the concealed entrance to the lower ground vestibule/ utility room whose end wall is made of glass bricks facing the street.",
                "The garden side of the terrace also has a cantilevered brick upper floor with picture windows forming an almost continuous band of glazing. A deep terrace, accessed through a sliding glazed door from the kitchen / dining room, runs across the whole building at the first floor. Wire mesh screens, up which plants can be grown, separate each terrace from the next. Sheet steel spiral staircases projecting from the building and protruding into neighbours’ air space link this level to a patio below and from there down steps to the communal garden."

                "The main internal feature is the post-tensioned wooden spiral stair connecting all three floors. The treads and risers are of birch ply as are the first and second storey floors. Walls are painted blockwork. Doors are all full height giving a feeling of spaciousness; some partitions are space-saving sliding doors. Windows, external doors and balustrades are of chunky dark stained softwood.",

The brick-paved rear terrace (now re-tiled) extends inwards to form a heated raised brick step. The wood surround of the main spiral stair forms one wall of the dining area."

To take advantage of ‘Economy 7’ cheaper night time electricity, heating of the upper and middle floors was by large blockwork storage slabs located in the central core. These slowly released heat through vents during the day, with a boost option controlled by a thermostat. The brickwork step on to the terrace in the kitchen/ dining room was also heated.",

                "Insulation has been added to the flat roof and internally  on external-facing walls; double glazed windows have been installed where possible. The heat pump supplies hot water and heating to all floors through a combination of underfloor pipes and wall-mounted radiators."

                "‘When I designed Winscombe Street I had no idea it would be followed by such projects. I designed paved terraces, stained softwood windows with sliding frames, timber balustrades with mesh infill, sliding doors and kitchens with tiled worktops looking integral with the house, a part of its primary architecture. The same elements, modified to the different circumstances, have been repeated throughout the three schemes’ (Brown)."
