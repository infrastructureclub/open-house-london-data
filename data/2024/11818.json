These friezes tell the story of the building’s history and also help illustrate its new purpose as a space for innovation and collaboration.",

                "Our strategy for the building had three main aims:",
                "1) Open the blocked-up high street frontage and create a visible new platform for culture and community.\n2) Create publicly accessible spaces on the ground floor to support and celebrate collective learning, cultural production and exchange. \n3) Design workspaces on the first and second floors that reflect a variety of professional stages. So if you’re a hybrid worker, solopreneur, or startup, you’ll have access to a wonderful space that reflects your working rhythm.",
