As a result it has a very small nave but large and unequal-sized transepts. Georgian box pews are its best known feature. The two-decker pulpit dates from 1796. The graveyard contains several memorials of historical and architectural interest.",

                "There has been a church on the site since Saxon times. The earliest reference to it is in the Domesday survey 1086, suggesting it had already been there for may years. A small part of the existing chancel dates from Norman times; the blocked Norman lancet window in the north wall can still be seen from outside. The church was largely  rebuilt in 1505. The lower part of the tower dates from then, but the upper section was rebuilt in 1790 (the bell bears the date '1620'). Further enlargements were carried out in subsequent centuries., notably the Georgian period during which the current box pews were installed. \nThere are many interesting memorials in the church and the churchyard.  The most famous figure buried there is Captain George Vancouver (1758-1798), the explorer who discovered Vancouver Island.  He lived latterly in Petersham; there is also a memorial to him in the church.",
