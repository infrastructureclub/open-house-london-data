The chapel at the heart of Abney Park nature reserve was Europe's first non-denominational funeral chapel, designed by William Hosking to reflect a lack of bias to any one Christian sect. Abney Park residents include many radicals and dissenters - abolitionists, suffragettes, Quakers, Chartists and free thinkers - for this reason. The Chapel is the only surviving building designed by Hosking and has recently been restored by Kaner Olette and reopened as a venue for weddings, memorials, music and community events. The architect and stained glass artist will be available to talk about their role in the restoration."
