While we all know the City’s roots date back to the Roman Empire, we don’t know much about how this small port rose up during the British Empire. This Square Mile grew wealthy off the back of Britain becoming a maritime power. It turned away from the churches, and huge profits came from trading goods and people. Banks and insurance giants were created with a legacy that remains today. With its riches, it built prestigious buildings, symbolising architectural grandeur."
