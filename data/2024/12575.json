                "Thornton House provides 14 \nhigh quality new homes within an \nexisting estate in Balham, London. \nFBM’s regenerative design \napproach optimised the number \nof homes whilst enhancing \nthe surrounding amenity for \nexisting and new residents - as \npart of the redevelopment of \nthe site, a new Health and Wellbeing Garden was provided, \nincluding a new under 5s play \nspace, exercise zone and food \ngrowing opportunities, with \nfurther improvements to lighting \nand landscaping along the street \nfrontage and site boundary. \nThe new apartments are arranged \naround an open central stair \ncore within a compact urban \nvilla, orientated to provide an \nimproved street frontage along \nThornton Road whilst reducing \nwindow to window distances from \nneighbours. Ranging in height \nfrom two to five storeys, the \nnew building acts as a transition \nbetween the seven storey existing \nestate building to the north and \nthe two-storey Edwardian villas to \nthe south and west. \nPassive environmental solutions \nhave been a key consideration, \nwith 60% of the dwellings being \ndouble aspect, and 40% triple \naspect. Recessed balconies \nnot only increase privacy, but \nact as a shading device for the \nfloor to ceiling glazed doors \nand windows. The development \nwas designed to achieve a 72% \nreduction in carbon dioxide \nemissions through a combination \nof air source heat pumps (ASHP), \na highly efficient envelope, PV \npanels on the roof, and thermally \nefficient double-glazed windows.\nAll the apartments benefit from \na generous recessed balcony or \nterrace typically connected to the \nopen plan kitchen dinning/living \nspace. The scheme was designed \nas car-free, but provides one onstreet parking bay on Thornton \nRoad for blue badge holders \nonly; cycle parking is provided for \nfuture and existing residents. \nFinally, the scheme achieved an \nurban greening factor of 0.4. \nThe landscape design enhances \nbiodiversity by introducing habitat \ninterventions - such as log piles, \nbird and bat boxes, and bug \nhotels - and food sources for \nwildlife through a diverse planting \nscheme, all of which can support \na wider network of vegetation and \nmigration corridors."
