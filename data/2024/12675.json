Although the original building, the second in the neighbourhood, succumbed to subsidence in the 1970's its firm Christian foundation remains strong.  Local people are variously commemorated, not least Edward Handley whose family manufactured bricks in their Woodside works until the 1960's; Anthony Trythall the auctioneer and one-time Croydon councillor, and former Croydon Mayor Frank Denning who made his fortune locally in the milk trade."
