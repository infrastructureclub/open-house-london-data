In 2011 the space was taken on by Dolores Maisonneuve and Gordon Haskins who converted the building into the art studios and events space that we now know it as! \nThe amount of people who have passed through these doors over the years can be felt and observed in the subtle marks left behind. We want to celebrate the importance of noticing and taking care of our old and historic buildings with a particular focus on preventative repair rather than restoration."
