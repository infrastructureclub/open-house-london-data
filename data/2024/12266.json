The world is in the grip of multiple crises: the climate emergency; food poverty; diet-related mental and physical disease and many of us feel totally disconnected from the natural world. We're on a mission to change this. Good food is our religion. We have a vision of a world where the food we eat nourishes both people and planet. From our beautiful farm in South East London, we are creating a better Sitopia, where we reconnect people to the soil, to the joy of good food and flowers and to each other.",
