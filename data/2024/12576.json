He was attracted to the 32-metre-long cottage garden and the charm and vibrancy of the area.  \n \nIan wanted to create a warm, light home with an expressive structure, framing the view of his newly planted climate-resilient prairie garden.",
                "He wanted an efficient, ergonomic home where he could display his collection of art and glassware, entertain friends and family, and retreat at the end of a busy day. He was keen to retain the DNA of the Victorian cottage, restoring it where possible, particularly its front elevation."

                "The garden and cottage are designed to be robust, low-maintenance, and beautifully functional.",
                "Ian appointed Whittaker Parsons in 2021, who proposed a total remodelling of the ground floor. They replaced the poor-quality and inefficient rear extensions with one large wrap-around extension containing a new kitchen and dining area overlooking the garden. They designed a large rooflight to bring natural light into the centre of the plan and reinstated a partition between the central reception room and stairs, creating a WC under the stairs. \n \nThe extension, upgrades and landscaping at Flitch Cottage are designed with a changing climate in mind.  \n \nThe new rear extension is a contemporary addition to the Conservation Area. It has a striking timber and cranked flitch beam roof (a composite beam of timber and steel) to minimise the depth of structural elements and use fewer large sections of steel. The extension walls are built from Enviroblock, a building block produced from secondary and recycled materials. New thermal elements are highly insulated.",
                "The extension's ceiling is lined with FSC plywood.  The juxtaposition of the new roof forms and exposed structural elements sliding past each other adds energy to the space.  The different roof forms also help to break up the room, creating zones with varying amounts of natural light and volume, making the space feel more generous.",
                "The new kitchen is compact but well-planned and economical. It is neatly arranged along the party wall and has a central island with a Neolith worktop, a material manufactured with 100% natural raw materials.",
                "Elegant aluminium sliding doors provide level access onto the rear patio and a view across the garden beyond. Designed and planted by Ian, a combination of grasses, shrubs and flowering perennials to attract pollinators."
