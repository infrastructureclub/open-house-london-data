While the Hall has been updated, beautified, repaired and restored over the centuries, weathering fires and bombing raids along the way, it is a living building which continues to serve the functions for which it was built, and remains at the heart of our collegiate life, educational activity and cultural enrichment.\nOn display will be an exhibition charting the Hall through the years alongside rare pieces from our archive. The elaborately carved screen is an exuberant riot of classical detail and embellishment, is thought to have been the work of Protestant Huguenot refugees from continental Europe."
