Working in this way, 3000 people have been rallied to the cause who will take the message about the project back to their communities.",
                "The project has required us to re-design the entire construction process to facilitate experimentation, adjustment and participation within the confines of a modest construction budget. With an uncompromising focus on reuse, the project sets a precedent for sustainable construction whilst unleashing the potential of the construction process itself to convey skills and contribute to greater community coherence in an area of London that is undergoing rapid transformation.",
                "Built from 60% reused materials (measured by volume),  the Paper Garden easily exceeds the LETI (Low Energy Transformation  Initiative) 2030 target. In fact, we are 7 years ahead of one of the most ambitious targets set by any organisation in the UK.",
