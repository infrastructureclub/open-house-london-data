                "Music with Plants by the Glasshouse is an opportunity to connect with the colour, textures and processes of plants through soothing sounds and sensing prompts. They’ll be a base on the cut grass lawn, exploration inside the glasshouses, and an opportunity to share impressions. We will consider the Reconstructed Victorian Glasshouses - their spatial purpose to house a global collection of diverse plant life; the colours of the plants from Purple Spiderwort to Pink Panther; readings from E A Bowles - the gardener, botanist and artist behind the heritage gardens at Myddelton House; and reciprocal relations with plants.\nWith Cath Carver - artist, broadcaster, curator, colour experience facilitator and founder of Colour Your City - an arts and research practice, active in sensory, spatial and social engagement.",
