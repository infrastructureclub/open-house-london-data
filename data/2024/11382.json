                "The first family to settle at the moated site was the de Scathebury family around 1200AD. In 1424 Thomas Walsingham bought the estate. The Walsingham family had connections with the royal court; the brick manor house and farm buildings date from their time. Queen Elizabeth I visited Scadbury in 1597. The family sold Scadbury Manor to Sir Richard Bettenson in 1660. The estate was later purchased by John Selwyn and settled upon his son-in-law Thomas Townshend. The moated manor house was pulled down in 1738 but in the 20th century the family lived in a country house nearby. The Home Guard had a base at Scadbury during World War II.  In 1983 the family sold the estate to Bromley Council."
