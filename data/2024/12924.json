Is this a nostalgic trend, or are we genuinely returning to the heyday of ‘the parade’ concept - where the butcher, baker, greengrocer, and newsagent are just a short stroll away?",
                "Concrete Communities + Aucoot will explore how the built environment is evolving in response to our desire for more connected communities, regenerated neighbourhoods, and a rejection of chain store monopolies. We invite you to join a conversation about whether, in an era dominated by Amazon deliveries and Uber Eats, we can still find joy in the personalised service offered by independent local shopkeepers. Are we on the brink of balancing both worlds or is one model destined to succeed?",
