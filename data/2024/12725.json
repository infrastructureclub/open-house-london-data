As a corner house located on a busy junction, the owners aimed to create a home that not only brings joy to their family but also enlivens the street and delights passers-by.",
                "With elevations on three sides and a wraparound garden, the design features faceted walls and strategically placed openings that choreograph light throughout the living spaces. These elements allow natural light to create dynamic compositions of dappled patterns.",
                "The different shades of lilac are layered like icing on a cake, inspired by the bold graphics of digital art and American diners. As you walk around the house, you'll discover brightly colored drainage pipes and chequerboard-patterned tiles that provide moments of delight. The sculpted porch at the front, with its striking pink hood and butter-yellow columns, is like the cherry on top of this lilac house."
