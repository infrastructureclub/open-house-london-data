                "St Bartholomew’s Hospital has led the provision of healthcare in London for 900 years. Founded in 1123 by a man named Rahere to provide care for the poor of the City of London, there is no other hospital in the country which matches its record of continuous service on the same site.",
                "This magnificent heritage site is still a working hospital. Alongside state of the art modern facilities, the historic buildings consist of: the Gatehouse (1702); the hospital church of St. Bartholomew the Less, with its 15th century tower; and the remaining three James Gibbs blocks,  built between 1732 and 1769 (the North, East and West  Wings), around a grand Square, with its elegant Fountain (1859).  Alongside the Gatehouse are some fine Grade II listed Victorian buildings by Hardwick.",
                "The North Wing is currently closed as it will be the subject of a landmark conservation and restoration project due to start in the summer of 2023 - led by Barts Heritage.  The Museum will also close from 1 September 2023 due to the restoration programme."
