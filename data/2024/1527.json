Lasdun designed a modernist building drawing inspiration from the structure of the human body with classical elements, dramatic interiors and space to celebrate our ceremony and history. It is one of the few post-war buildings to be awarded Grade I listed status. In 1992 Lasdun was awarded the Royal Institute of British Architects’ Trustees Medal in recognition of his work at the RCP, considered to be ‘the best architecture of its time anywhere in the world’.",

The lower level includes the low humped exterior of the Wolfson Lecture Theatre clad in blue-grey engineering brick and creating surprising curves to contrast with the straight lines above.
