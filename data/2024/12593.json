                "The tour will explain the history of the energy industry in London, and how it has affected London’s sustainable strategy as we know it today. The Industrial Revolution, although detrimental to the environment, was a necessary and important step to pave the way for sustainable infrastructure that is shaping London’s image as one of the most ‘livable’ and ‘sustainable’ cities today. We will cover the history of London through its environmental journey, comparing architecture, energy production, and building materials in the 19th century and earlier to nowadays. We will explore the following questions and more: \nCan London ever abate its historical carbon footprint? (and does it have to?)\nHow can you quantify health benefits from green infrastructure? \nWhat role do buildings play in helping the UK reach its net zero targets?"
