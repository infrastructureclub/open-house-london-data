                "The Pavilion's area takes the form of a 160 x 160 metre arrow pointing west to Ireland & the sunset. Invisibly occupying part of the Gardens, itself once a King’s playground, the work's concept echoes & reframes the fading colonial notion of a \"... vast [British] empire on which the sun never sets\" (the words of British colonial administrator Earl George Macartney in his \"An Account of Ireland in 1773 by a Late Chief Secretary of that Kingdom\").",
                "By walking through different zones in the specific area by the Serpentine Gallery in Kensington Gardens while using your mobile phone, the Echoes app and headphones, you become a participatory listener producing a composition in real-time. Your navigation creates a unique choreography via GPS, combining and changing sounds mapped in the Gardens through the app. Hear the park and its context become transformed by the many sounds forming this floating acoustic architecture, revealing an immersive, profoundly spatial and physical experience. The Pavilion has no visible presence outside the app and can only be accessed and enjoyed on-site.",
                "To access it - download the Echoes app https://explore.echoes.xyz/ then download the audiowork in the echoes app (not a browser) via link https://explore.echoes.xyz/collections/LjFLJZ2MAZopyVUw or QR code & save it to your phone so its ready to open when at the location.",
