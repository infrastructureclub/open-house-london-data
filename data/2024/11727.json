                "The adaptation and extension of the former London Metropolitan School of Art, Architecture and Design, provides over 150,000 square feet of office space. Located opposite the Whitechapel Gallery, the scheme adds to the existing six storey building with an equal volume above. The new build element mimics the horizontal banding and the rhythm of the panels of the 1960s concrete building but contrasts this with a lightweight steel structure and dark metal palette.\nTension between old and new is highlighted by an inhabited gap, marked out by a playful piece of public art visible from the street to create a visual break. This space forms one of several external spaces, including a large planted terrace at roof level and shared multi-use amenity space for the building users.\nConcrete defines the existing building and steel is the predominant material of the new build elements. The upper floors feature an exposed steel structure with large spans and generous floor-to-ceiling heights, contrasting with the as found quality of the floors below."
