                "The Glamorous world of Art Deco emerged in Paris and spread to London by the mid-1920s. Every part of life was caught up in a spirit of optimism and change. Innovative architecture with new materials, whole changes in fashion and entertainment with interiors boasting new stylish fabrics and furniture.\nStreatham was changing in the 1930s and rapidly, becoming the Art Deco capital of South London. With three Deco Cinemas, Britain’s first purpose-built ballroom and a recent theatre Streatham could entertain nearly 11,000 people seeking a night out!\nWe enjoy Grade 2 listed buildings, walk in a conservation area and discuss Pulman Court - the visionary Modernist residential site. Throughout, we encounter 1930s blocks of trendy apartments with their own built-in social life once boasting dance floors, gardens and swimming pools. As for Deco ornament, we find Egyptian-themed interiors, stained glass, new designs of ironwork, stepped and zig-zag decoration and even spot elephants observing from above and leaping gazelles on the ground!\nOur 90-minute walking tour will see Streatham in a new light with West End actors, celebrities and entrepreneurs changing the face of one of the longest High Streets in Europe."
