                "And yet. Throughout history Croydon has proved itself a one-of-a-kind. A palatial stomping ground for the Archbishops of Canterbury. An Eden-esque spa designed by the architect who'd work on Kew Gardens and London Zoo. A swanky shopping mecca rivalling Oxford Street. A hub of continental air travel and magnet for Hollywood royalty. A daring experiment in futuristic 1960s brutalist architecture. Croydon produced the Damned, Stormzy and RAYE. It pioneered new forms of railways, gave us one of the funniest sitcoms ever and invented the predecessor to Lego.",
