The estate, inspired partly by Viennese social housing still catches the eye with its archways, courtyards and white facades; its steel-frame construction, not visible to the eye, was equally innovative. Cecil Levita, the chair of the London County Council’s Housing Committee, believed it ‘a noteworthy scheme which would mark a new departure in the construction of buildings’.",
                "In other respects, it is a more conventional estate of its time – essentially a walk-up, balcony-access tenement block of a type very common in central London. Low-rise cottage estates remained the ideal for most but the need to clear inner-city slums and rehouse locally and at density those in Somers Town who lived in some of the worst housing in the capital compelled a multi-storey solution. It might uniquely have been a nine-storey scheme with lifts, unheard of in working-class dwellings of the era, had the original proposals of the London County Council to build a nine-storey, mixed-use, public-private scheme (featuring shops and offices, middle-class apartments as well as working-class tenements) proved viable.",
