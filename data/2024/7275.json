                "Generations of Lambeth residents made their way underneath the elegant arch around the door of number 39 Black Prince Road for many different reasons over the last century. Entering the building as pupils, as teachers, as workers supporting the war effort, or even to make films, they could not have helped but be struck by the solid grandeur of the building.",
                "From the cast-iron railings facing onto Vauxhall Street and Black Prince Road, through the Art Nouveau friezes on the frontage, the high ceilings, to the huge main hall with its trusses exposed against the white ceiling, the Beaufoy Institute makes a beautiful impression.",
                "The Beaufoy Institute, now a listed building, was first brought into use in 1907 as a school for underprivileged children. The Institute continued the mission of the old Lambeth Ragged School when that building was demolished and the land sold to the railway. After being a school and subsequently a technical institute for so long, the building fell into complete disuse for well over a decade, making it onto the risk register of English Heritage."

                "In 2012, Diamond Way Buddhism UK bid for the Beaufoy Institute and was successful in the bid, the subsequent planning application and purchase. The Beaufoy is now partially renovated and has been functioning as a Diamond Way Buddhist Centre, offering a regular programme consisting of meditations and lectures on Buddhism. Alongside the regular programme, there are special events, such as teaching events with Buddhist teachers, which usually attract hundreds of people from in and outside the UK. This recent usage fits well with the compassionate ethos that the building has had from the beginning.",
                "As Erica Beaufoy, a member of the Beaufoy Family after whom the Institute is named, said on the occasion of the public opening:",
                "“the Institute must have given a sigh of relief when  Diamond Way came to her rescue ...”",
                "Whereas before, Beaufoy was dedicated to learning about skills for life and developing rounded human qualities, these days, one can now add learning about the nature of the mind through Buddhist methods.",
                "As representatives of Diamond Way Buddhism, we have occupied the building since 2013 and have been completing renovations in several parts of the building; this has included structural works, such as installing the water/ electricity and heating systems. We have also been renovating walls, staircases, roof parts, and interior. The renovations are continuing, and we are currently focusing on work in the main hall.",
                "We have an ongoing Buddhist teaching and meditation programme and offer daily meditation to the public (daily at 8 pm), including weekly introduction talks on Thursdays at 7.30 pm. We also organise bigger events with our main teachers, which are advertised on our webpage."
