The pile is a pinnacle of early 21st century construction-design. It is one of the earliest remaining examples of the ‘Designed Foundation Movement’, a reactionary force of designers working against the thoughtless pouring of concrete into the ground and sealing of the soil.",

A time capsule we leave behind in the ground, as evidence of how we build and treat the earth for future generations.",
