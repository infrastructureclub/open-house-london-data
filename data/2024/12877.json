                "Tonkin Liu and the client Friends of Crystal Palace Dinosaurs, the team that brought the Dinosaur Swing Bridge to life, will describe the process of the bridge’s inception, evolution, and construction, how the design emerged and improved, and how a community deepened their relationship with this pivotal structure that bridges heritage old and new.",
                "Palaeontologist Jeremy Young, who has researched the site in detail, will take you on a behind-the-scenes tour of the constructed outcrops that give the Deep Time narrative to the CP Dinosaurs. Then we will swing the bridge open, inviting everyone to walk across the bridge onto the Dinosaur Islands and show the planting and the geology.",
                "The significance of this Grade-1-Listed site lies beyond the inescapable delight of the concrete sculptures and landscapes from 1854 – it was a groundbreaking innovation in experiential learning through ‘edu-tainment’. This first-ever ‘walk through geologic time’ was pivotal in democratisation of public engagement with science, deserving of the most innovative, complementary structure we can build today."
