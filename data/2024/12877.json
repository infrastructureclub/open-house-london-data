                "You will see the bridge in action and create your own part-model of the Swing Bridge’s structural principles with a laser-cut print-out and demo. Palaeontologist Jeremy Young will show the sequence of strategies on the islands. Then we will swing the bridge open, inviting everyone to walk across the bridge onto the Dinosaur Islands and show the planting and the geology.",
                "The significance of this Grade-1-Listed site lies beyond the inescapable delight of the concrete sculptures and landscapes from 1854 – it was a groundbreaking innovation in experiential learning through ‘edu-tainment’. This first-ever ‘walk through geologic time’ was pivotal in democratisation of public engagement with science, deserving of the most innovative, complementary structure we can build today."
