It was one of the first public libraries with open access shelves and offered one of the UK's first Children’s Libraries. The Clocktower Building was opened in 1993, designed by award-winning architect Mick Timpson. Now retired from architecture, Timpson is Chair of Cheshire West and Chester Design Review Panel.",
                "Join us for series of events celebrating the unique architectural design of Croydon Central Library and Clocktower Building: a tour of the building from its architect, Mick Timpson; and an accompanying exhibition display of Timpson's original architectural drawings, held by Croydon Archives.",
                "The tour will provided unique insight into the building's design strategy, including the design of the Children’s library, the reason for the curved wall, how the glazed roof works, collaborating with an artist, the materials chosen to work with the original town hall, the creation of the cinema and how the new section came in under the Braithwaite Hall to make the entrance.  how a detailed design response was developed which carefully balanced together Croydon as a place, the history and character of the original town hall, and the role of the library to help establish a new sense of place, centre and identity in the town."
