                "Victoria Station Arcade opened in 1911. It was constructed by the District Railway as part of a pattern of retail construction at stations, with architects George and Frank Sherrin designing similar arcades at Liverpool Street, South Kensington, and High Street Kensington. Its units feature details from both the Edwardian period and the 1920s, when the Arcade was modified for construction of the adjacent Victoria Station House office block. These details include coloured glass, carved wreaths bearing the District Railway logo, and curved shopfront windows. Of special note are the art deco “sunburst” embellishments in one of the shops.\nThe units were modified heavily in the 1970s, with the original mahogany and marble finishes adorning the shopfront covered by aluminium. Despite this, there were sufficient elements remaining for English Heritage to award the site Grade II listing in 2014, citing it as an example of Edwardian retail architecture. \nIn 2021, TfL restored the arcade. The exterior stonework was repaired. On the interior, the 1970s modifications were removed, with the finishes restored and repaired. This site will provide visitors with an opportunity to see behind the scenes of the restored arcade."
