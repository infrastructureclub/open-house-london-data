                "A unique industrial building, the last of its kind in London. Originally a Victorian hospital for horses, it was then a printer that was left abandoned. Roger K Burton carefully studied and researched its history, restoring it and opening it up to the public as an arts space and clothing archive. For 30 years it has been operating as a very unique blend of creative endeavours, championing the underground, subcultures and interesting artists.  This may be the last chance to see the building, as the owners have shown no interest in renewing the lease and we will no longer be operating in the space.\nWe look forward to seeing you in our treasured space."
