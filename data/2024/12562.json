                "This tour follows the extraordinary trajectory of one of London's most overlooked and reviled areas: the Elephant and Castle. From its earliest origins as a marsh ridden area of market gardens and peach orchards, to its heyday in the 18th and 19th centuries, to its dramatic decline and fall, the walk explores the buildings and people that defined this area through history. On the journey, we will discover enormous pleasure gardens rife with exotic animals; the largest cinema in Europe; what was once the tallest residential skyscraper in Britain; architectural gems by Erno Goldfinger… and much more. With the recent creation of Elephant Park and a £4.8 billion regeneration fund, now is the time to rediscover this neglected part of London as it restates its claim to being the 'Piccadilly of the South’."
