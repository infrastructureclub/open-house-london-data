                "The Museum of London has embarked on an exciting journey to create a new museum for London. We have a once-in-a- generation opportunity to reconceive what a museum could and should be. London is the most magnetic city in the world and we need a museum that is just as compelling – a shared place for Londoners who want to feel more rooted in the city, and for UK and global visitors seeking authentic London experiences and stories.",
                "Our newly created London Museum will occupy market buildings in Smithfield – saving the historic General Market site for generations to come. Moving to Smithfield means that the museum will be able to do so much more. It will give us street-level entrances in a wonderful neighbourhood, better transport links courtesy of the Elizabeth line, and the opportunity to create innovative new galleries, exhibitions and events. Sitting at the heart of the historic City of London, the London Museum will be a space for learning, exploration and adventure, welcoming millions more visitors and showcasing more of the London Collection than ever before, a place where London’s stories cross and collide.",
                "The London Museum will open early and close late – reflecting London’s position as a 24-hour global city. Extended opening hours on Friday and Saturday nights will attract visitors to Smithfield throughout the weekend, and the new museum will support a host of independent small businesses around its perimeter, creating jobs and creative opportunities.",
                "In its new home, the museum will sit in an area of unique historic interest. Smithfield has been a Roman cemetery, a place of execution, home of the boisterous Bartholomew Fair, and a grimy muse for Charles Dickens. The first written record of the ‘smooth field’ dates back to the 1170s, by which time it was already a bustling livestock market – a use that continued for centuries."
