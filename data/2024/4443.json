                "Drawing on Goldfinger’s philosophy of shared life, the service tower which gives the building its distinctive silhouette has been smartly converted into a series of unique communal spaces by Studio Egret West and Ab Rogers Design. Draw back the curtain on the third floor to reveal a cocooning red cinema room, complete with state-of-the-art audio visual system and armchairs by Stockholm studio Massproductions. For supper clubs and special occasions, there’s a fully-equipped kitchen on the 27th floor, connected to a bookable dining room for up to twelve by a powder pink slatted staircase. Other levels house a fitness space, a mirrored yoga studio with ladder barrel and a table tennis room. A new communal roof garden champions naturalistic planting. Residents also have access to a range of characterful co-working spaces throughout the building. The library evokes a midcentury palette with its sophisticated primary hues and modernist Robin Day recliners, alongside apple green shelves stocked with art, design and architecture reference books. Two other dedicated workspaces have their own character, from cork walls to architectural bar lighting."

                "Sitting at the junction of the Limehouse Cut canal and the Bow section of the River Lea Navigation, well-connected Poplar is synonymous with east London’s waterways. Extensively damaged during the second world war due to its dockside location, the area saw significant post-war regeneration and now attracts families, young professionals and creatives for its transport links and strong community feel.\n \nPoplar is home to a host of arts and community projects, including R-Urban eco hub with its garden workshops and Poplar Works, a makerspace which houses best-in-class bakery E5 Bakehouse alongside forty studios for artists and designers. Both Chrisp Street, with its historic market, and Aberfeldy Village to the east are tipped for major regeneration.\n \nOnly a twenty-minute walk from Balfron Tower, Canary Wharf’s skyscrapers sit in stark contrast to Poplar’s network of low-rise apartment blocks, Victorian terraces and neighbourhood parks. The area is predominantly served by Langdon Park and All Saints DLR stations, with several a short walk away, as well as the Elizabeth Line from Canary Wharf."
