Since its inception it has been promoting the understanding of astronomy and geophysics by organising meetings, publishing research, maintaining a specialist library and archive among other activities. The Society originally occupied rooms in Lincoln’s Inn, and later, Somerset House. The Society’s apartments in Burlington House were specially built by the government for the learned societies when they were required to vacate Somerset House. The RAS now shares the courtyard of Burlington House with the premises of five other learned societies: the Linnean Society of London, the Society of Antiquaries, the Royal Society of Chemistry and the Geological Society of London, together with the Royal Academy of Arts. The insignia of the Society are traced into the fabric of the building, from the monograms in the entrance hall and lobby to the etchings on the stained glass 'cosmic spiral' window on the first floor landing. This stunning window was designed and produced by Sally Scott, in association with Nero Designs, when the building was refurbished by Peregrine Bryant Associates in 2007."
