The Crematorium lies within the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. It is situated on the banks of the River Thames by Chiswick Bridge and serves the west and south-west of London.",
                "Mortlake Crematorium was licensed in 1936 under the Mortlake Crematorium Act 1936, thereby becoming the first to be established under its own Act of Parliament. The building was designed by Douglas Barton, an employee of the Hammersmith Metropolitan Borough Council. It was constructed in three years at a cost of £27,000. It was equipped with a Garden of Remembrance for the burial or scattering of ashes, and also offered panels and niches in which ashes could be deposited. The facility was finally opened in January 1939 by Lord Horder, the then physician to the King.",
                "Mortlake Crematorium’s outward appearance changed little over the following years. However the grounds, gardens and building have been well kept and maintained."

                "The assessment stated: \n“Cleverly designed, with a variety of spaces, Mortlake is clearly a very good example of its type. The chapel interior is impressive spatially, and the overall ensemble is virtually unaltered. It is a distinctive Art Deco design that survives little altered in a compact and practical composition.”",
                "Reasons for designation decision\nA well-executed and characterful variation on the classic crematorium design\nPleasing elevations and arcaded cloisters\nGood quality detailing and interesting planning form\nVery little altered since it opened in 1939"
