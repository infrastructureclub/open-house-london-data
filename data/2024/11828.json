                "The Sight and Sound building, originally known as the Italian Hospital, was founded in 1884 by Italian businessman, Giovanni Ortelli. The hospital was run by the Sisters of Charity of St Vincent de Paul for the Italian community in London until it closed over a century later.",
                "Shortly after its closure, the hospital was taken over by Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) in 1992. Since then, it has been home to the Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity, patient and family accommodation, and the hospital creche. In 2021 the building re-opened as the Sight and Sound Centre at GOSH, the UK’s first dedicated facility for children and young people with sight and hearing loss."
