                "Sourced directly from our fruity farming partners, we get the best fruit delivered straight to our Soda Works. Lemons and oranges grown by the soon-to-be-famous Carmelo Laudani in Sicily, check. A variety of rhubarb grown just for us in the Yorkshire Rhubarb Triangle, you got it.",
                "Our team of skilled Soda Jerks source, squash, crush, pulp, squeeze, infuse, mash, macerate, wedge, juice, extract, smush, jam, (*deep breath*) pulverise, crunch, mill, reduce, pound, grind, liquidise, mince, chew, cuddle (jk) and press every single piece of fruit that enters our Soda Works so we can guarantee you get the best tasting liquid we can possibly make you.",
                "Once we've got our freshly squeezed juice, it's time to mix it into our soda recipes in small batches and then get those sodas into our packaging. Our Soda Jerks rinse, fill, cap, pasteurise (for shelf life), label and box up our sodas, ready to go out for you to enjoy.",

We'll end with a Q&A and tasting of some of our delicious sodas, including some fresh-off-the-line drinks. You will leave with an understanding of what the inner workings of a factory look like.",
