As part of these works, the surviving base of the mediaeval church tower in the old churchyard was stabilised and restored and the old churchyard developed into a public community garden and park. Both the old and new churchyard in which the current church now sits, are closed to burials and are maintained by Lewisham Council under the 1906 Open Spaces Act.",

It was the first of three churches dedicated to St Margaret of Antioch, and was probably built around 1080, although it was not mentioned in contemporary chronicles until 1275. The rest of the church was demolished in 1813. The outer walls of the nave and chancel have been marked in the grass by single stones. \n•\tThe current Church of St Margaret, which stands to the south side of Lee Terrace and is listed at Grade II*. It dates from 1839-41 by John Brown of Norwich, and replaces a church on the same site by Joseph Gwilt, 1813-14, which collapsed. The church was restored and enlarged in 1876 by James Brooks."
