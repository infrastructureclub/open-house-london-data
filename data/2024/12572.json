There is a tall tower and spire at the west end of the south aisle, a narthex at the west end of the nave, now used for offices, and a baptistry now used for small scale worship, meetings and consultations. Walls are generally solid brick, polychrome internally. The church retains a complete set of original Victorian stained-glass windows, depicting the parables (south aisle) and miracles (north aisle) of Jesus."

He then went on to produce several memorial statues of the Prince Consort, including one retained in the Royal Collection at the Royal Mausoleum, Frogmore.",
