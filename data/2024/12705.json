The main structure (the Dodeca-den) is a hightly versatile and unusual parachute-covered 12-sided/circular gathering space and living sculpture and is available to use by donation.",

                "Plot 9 is a council allotment but forget almost everything you might preconceive from this label, which is what artist Andy Millns did when conceiving what to do with the space. Split over two levels, it is the end plot of a strip of allotments alongside a railway that had been unused for 4 years and polluted with, amongst other things, hundreds of buried plastic compost bags and masses of carpet.",
                "Given the low ground rents on allotments and long-term security, Andy Millns saw an unique opportunity to create a community gathering space with equal emphasis on utility and beauty.  Andy's background is in technology where he co-founded a company specialising in producing multi-sensory immersive experience using the latest 3D technologies. He has brought his passion for creating fantastical worlds from the digital to the analog realm and views the space not as a small piece of land but as a large installation artwork of human and nature connection.",
                "The garden's overall goal is to create beautiful versatile botanical spaces for human connection. The main gathering space (the Dodeca-Den) and the project as a whole have come about through a process of emergent design with each gathering and visitor giving precious insight allowing the space to be iteratively improved to encourage guests to linger longer, connect more deeply and remove any friction or impediment to enjoying their time there.",
                "The space also acts as a statement to show what is possible in London if the ever-increasing commercial pressures that have closed many alternative events spaces are removed. The ground rent to the council for the 20 x 10m space is just Â£63 a year.",
                "The space is available to use by anyone providing therapeutic, creative or community-building activities, by donation, which go towards maintaining and improving the garden for community use."
