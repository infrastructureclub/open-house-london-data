                "The brief for the project was developed using nimtim’s briefing game and identified a desire for spaces that would be calming and restorative for adults to sit alongside spaces that were playful and robust for children. Two distinct zones were created: an area of movement defined by hardwearing finishes such as ply-lining and a softer more tactile zone defined by textural finishes including neutral-coloured textured natural plaster that gives a sense of warmth and diffused light.",
                "To demarcate these two separate layers of the house nimtim proposed an internal partition that would run vertically through the entire house: unifying new and old. This screen is infilled with panels of solid timber, fluted and clear glass to allow for natural light to diffuse across the spaces and frame views or provide privacy between the different uses.",
                "The open plan ground floor is anchored around a deep burgundy kitchen ‘room within a room’. Co-created and imagined by Holte kitchens, using a lego model the client brought to their showroom. The kitchen affords viewing onto the separate dining and living spaces through large hatches with sliding fluted glass screens allowing for connection and privacy when needed.",
                "Externally, the colour of the existing bricks provided the basis for a palette of warm reds, pinks and burgundies. New windows were installed with bespoke concrete lintels in a rich pink to provide solar shading and a connection with the existing windows remaining at the front.",
                "The outcome is a house whose simple exterior gives way to an interior that is full of diffused light and rich with texture and colour. Spaces that are welcoming and restorative."
