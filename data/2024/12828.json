                "The current rise and rise of craft brewing in London is quite amazing. And whilst the current craft brewing trend is a modern one, the beer industry itself is far from a recent phenomenon. Hence, we looked to London's history for inspiration to name the brewery. Reading through old dictionaries shows how many old words have become obsolete, especially \"canting\" or slang terminology. And there it was, amongst the old cant terms used in beer culture from over 300 years ago... Neckstamper.",
                "According to many accounts, the so-called \"neck-stamper\" was the slang term given to the pot-boy (or girl) at an ale-house or tavern since the 1600s. One of the neck-stamper's jobs was to collect drinking vessels - bottles or tankards - that had previously been sent out full of beer to private homes or other establishments. Yes...takeaway beer in the 17th century!"
