While the extension\nmade it easier for millions to move around the city, it also\ncreated some of London’s most iconic architecture.\nThe person largely responsible for the look and feel of\nthe extension was Chief Architect Roland Paoletti, who\ncame to the Underground after working on Hong Kong’s\nmetro system. He recruited different architects to design\nthe stations, each guided by an overarching brief.\nOutside this brief, architects were free to infuse the\nstations with their personalities. As a result, each\nstation has a distinct personality in its design, which will be explored in more detail on the hunt. \nSeveral of the stations were nominated for the Stirling\nPrize in architecture and the Royal Fine Art Commission\nawarded the entire extension the Millennium Building\nof the Year in 2000."
