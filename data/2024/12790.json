It is filled with small moments of craft and consideration, whilst having an overall coherence and contemplative character. The positioning of windows allows light to rake across the textured clay painted walls, and the water from the pond is reflected on the exposed beams of the overhanging roof. Whilst only a small space, its layering and connection to the garden make it feel much bigger than the sum of its parts."
