Together, we’ll step beyond sightseeing and into the city itself – using movement, touch, and deep listening to explore the hidden stories and unique architecture of the area’s most iconic Brutalist design.\r\n\r\nThis is a creative, hands-on journey through some of the city’s most globally recognised built environment. Inspired by parkour and gentle choreography, we’ll move with and through the space around us – climbing, stretching, and slowing down to really feel the place beneath our feet. You don’t need any dance or parkour experience,  just a curious body and an open mind.\r\nPerfect for visitors, locals, artists and anyone wanting a deeper connection to London’s urban landscape.",
